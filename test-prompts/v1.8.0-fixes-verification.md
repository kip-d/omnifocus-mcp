## Test Instructions for Claude Desktop

I'm testing the OmniFocus MCP bridge v1.8.0 after recent bug fixes. Please run through these tests systematically and report any errors or unexpected behavior. After each test, briefly confirm success or describe any issues.

### Test 1: Project Creation with Review Intervals
Create a new project called "Weekly Review Test Project" with a weekly review interval. Set it to be reviewed every Monday.

### Test 2: Complex Project Creation
Create a project called "Q1 2025 Goals" with:
- A note saying "Quarterly objectives and key results"
- Flagged status
- Sequential task ordering
- Review interval of 3 months
- Due date of "2025-03-31 17:00" (use this exact format, not ISO 8601)

### Test 3: Query Tasks (Consolidated Tool)
Use the `query_tasks` tool to:
1. First, list all tasks (query_type: "list") with a limit of 10
2. Then search for tasks containing "email" (query_type: "search")
3. Show me overdue tasks (query_type: "overdue")
4. Show upcoming tasks for the next 7 days (query_type: "upcoming")

### Test 4: Folder Management
1. Create a new folder called "2025 Projects"
2. Update the folder name to "2025 Active Projects"
3. List all folders to confirm the change

### Test 5: Review Management (Consolidated Tool)
Use the `manage_reviews` tool to:
1. List all projects due for review in the next 30 days (operation: "list_for_review")
2. If any projects are listed, mark the first one as reviewed (operation: "mark_reviewed")

### Test 6: Create Tasks with Parent-Child Relationships
1. Create a parent task called "Prepare Presentation"
2. Create three subtasks under it:
   - "Research topic"
   - "Create slides"
   - "Practice delivery"

### Test 7: Batch Operations
Use the `batch_task_operations` tool to:
1. Create 3 simple tasks first: "Test Task A", "Test Task B", "Test Task C"
2. Then use batch_task_operations to complete all three at once

### Test 8: Task Properties and Advanced Features
Create a task called "Complex Task Example" with:
- Note: "This tests all advanced properties"
- Due date: "tomorrow at 5pm" (or use YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format)
- Defer date: "today at 9am" (or use YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format)
- Flagged: true
- Estimated duration: 45 minutes
- Tags: ["urgent", "work"] (Note: Tags will need to be set via update after creation)

### Test 9: Project with Folder Assignment
Create a project called "Folder Test Project" and place it in the "2025 Active Projects" folder (created in Test 4).

### Test 10: Analytics and Reporting
1. Show me productivity stats for the last 7 days
2. Export the last 5 tasks I created to CSV format

## Expected Results Summary

After running all tests, please provide a summary table like this:

| Test # | Test Name | Status | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Project with Review | ✅/❌ | Any errors or issues |
| 2 | Complex Project | ✅/❌ | Any errors or issues |
| 3 | Query Tasks | ✅/❌ | Any errors or issues |
| 4 | Folder Management | ✅/❌ | Any errors or issues |
| 5 | Review Management | ✅/❌ | Any errors or issues |
| 6 | Parent-Child Tasks | ✅/❌ | Any errors or issues |
| 7 | Batch Operations | ✅/❌ | Any errors or issues |
| 8 | Advanced Properties | ✅/❌ | Any errors or issues |
| 9 | Project in Folder | ✅/❌ | Any errors or issues |
| 10 | Analytics/Export | ✅/❌ | Any errors or issues |

## Known Limitations to Note

These are expected limitations, not bugs:
- Cannot move existing tasks to different parents (must create with parentTaskId)
- Cannot assign tags during task creation (use update_task after creation)
- Repeat rules for projects are temporarily disabled
- Some operations may take 5-30 seconds with large databases (especially upcoming tasks)
- Date formats: Use "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm" or relative dates like "tomorrow", avoid ISO 8601 with Z

## Critical Success Criteria

The following MUST work for v1.8.0 to be considered stable:
1. ✅ Projects create successfully with review intervals
2. ✅ No "Can't convert types" errors
3. ✅ Consolidated tools (query_tasks, manage_reviews, etc.) function correctly
4. ✅ Complex properties (dates, flags, notes) are set properly
5. ✅ Folder operations complete without errors
6. ⚠️ Batch operations should handle array parameters correctly (may need individual operations as fallback)

Please report any errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior you encounter during these tests.
