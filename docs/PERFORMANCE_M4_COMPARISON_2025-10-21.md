# M4 Pro (64GB) vs Plain M4 (32GB) - Hardware Comparison for Development

**Test Date**: October 21, 2025
**M4 Pro Machine**: 64GB RAM, 14-core CPU (current)
**Plain M4 Machine**: 32GB RAM, 10-core CPU (proposed)

---

## Executive Summary

**Can the plain M4 (32GB) replace your M4 Pro (64GB)?**

**Answer: Probably yes, but with tradeoffs.** Here's what to expect:

| Factor | Impact | Decision |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **CPU Performance** | 10 vs 14 cores = ~20-30% slower on parallel tasks | Acceptable for single-user dev |
| **RAM** | 32GB vs 64GB = sufficient for most work, but less headroom | Acceptable if you don't run heavy VMs |
| **Test Suite** | M4 Pro: 22.4s → M4 (estimated): 28-30s | Acceptable (still 4x better than M2) |
| **Single Tool** | I/O bound, so cores don't matter | No difference |
| **Cache Warmup** | Same speed (~1.6s) | No difference |

**Recommendation**: M4 32GB is viable if you prioritize **portability** and **cost**. Keep M4 Pro if you run **parallel workloads** or **CI testing**.

## Estimated M4 (32GB) Performance

### Scaling Factors

**CPU-intensive operations** (tags, stats, velocity):
- M4 has 86% of M4 Pro CPU cores (12/14)
- Expected slowdown: ~15-20% for CPU-bound work
- Parallelization: Limited to 10 performance cores instead of 12

**I/O-bound operations** (task queries):
- No difference expected (limited by OmniFocus AppleScript I/O)
- M4 Pro cold cache: 14s for today's tasks
- M4 cold cache: **14s (no change - I/O bound)**

### Estimated M4 (32GB) Results

```
Today's tasks:          ~14,000ms  (no change - I/O bound)
Overdue tasks:          ~3,100ms   (no change - I/O bound)
Upcoming tasks:         ~3,100ms   (no change - I/O bound)
Project statistics:       ~280ms   (+17% slower - CPU bound)
Tags (names only):        ~200ms   (+15% slower - CPU bound)
Tags (fast mode):         ~198ms   (+15% slower - CPU bound)
Tags (full mode):         ~895ms   (+16% slower - CPU bound)
Productivity stats:       ~945ms   (+17% slower - CPU bound)
Task velocity:            ~910ms   (+17% slower - CPU bound)
```

**Estimated Total**: All operations still < 1 second for non-I/O-bound work. Acceptable.

## Real-World Development Impact

### Test Suite Performance

**Current M4 Pro**: ~22.4 seconds full test suite

**Estimated M4 (32GB)**: ~26-28 seconds
- 20% slower due to reduced parallelization
- Still 4.7x faster than M2 Air (106s)
- **Assessment**: Acceptable

### Single Tool Execution

**M4 Pro**:
- Single task query: 2725ms
- Single project list: 239ms
- Single tag list: 174ms

**M4 (32GB) - Estimated**:
- Single task query: 2725ms (same - I/O bound)
- Single project list: 280ms (same - minimal CPU)
- Single tag list: 200ms (same - minimal CPU)

**Assessment**: No practical difference for single operations

### Development Workflow

**M4 Pro (14 cores)**:
- Run tests + compile + watch in parallel
- Good for CI/CD simulation
- Multiple tools being tested simultaneously

**M4 (32GB, 10 cores)**:
- Run tests + compile + watch in parallel (still works)
- Slower due to core contention
- Same tools, ~20% longer wait times

**Assessment**: Acceptable for daily development

## Recommendation Matrix

### ✅ Choose M4 (32GB) if:
- **You value portability** - Lighter, smaller form factor for moving between locations
- **You prioritize cost** - Save $1000, get 86% of M4 Pro performance
- **You work on single tasks** - I/O bound workloads show no difference
- **You don't run VMs** - 32GB is sufficient for standard development
- **You can accept 15-20% slower compile/test times** - Still plenty fast

### ✅ Keep M4 Pro (64GB) if:
- **You run parallel workloads** - 12 more cores help when compiling + testing + watching
- **You want maximum headroom** - 64GB handles concurrent Docker, VMs, browsers
- **You value predictable performance** - Less resource contention at peak usage
- **You optimize every second** - Shave 5-8s off test runs
- **You could resell M4 Pro** - Might not have opportunity to upgrade later

### ⚠️ Hybrid Approach (Not Recommended):
- Don't buy M4 32GB and keep M4 Pro as "secondary"
- Maintenance burden (syncing code, keeping both updated)
- The $1000 saved doesn't justify complexity
- Go all-in on one, or keep M4 Pro as main machine

---

## Decision Framework

**Ask yourself:**

1. **"Do I move between locations regularly?"**
   - Yes → M4 32GB (portability advantage)
   - No → M4 Pro (performance advantage)

2. **"How much does 5-8 seconds per test run matter?"**
   - A lot (optimization focused) → M4 Pro
   - Not much (it's still fast) → M4 32GB

3. **"Do I ever run heavy concurrent workloads?"**
   - Yes (VMs, Docker, CI testing) → M4 Pro
   - No (just development) → M4 32GB

4. **"Can I afford the $1000 difference comfortably?"**
   - Yes → M4 Pro (peace of mind)
   - Tight budget → M4 32GB

## How to Validate This Analysis

**Once you have M4 32GB, run these tests:**

```bash
# Full test suite (compare to M4 Pro baseline)
time npm test

# Benchmark suite (cold cache)
npm run benchmark

# Integration tests (real OmniFocus queries)
npm run test:integration

# Single tool execution
npm run build
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"tasks","arguments":{"mode":"today"}}}' | \
  time node dist/index.js 2>&1 | grep -A5 '"result"'
```

**Expected results:**
- Full test: ~26-28s (vs M4 Pro ~22.4s) → 15-20% slower ✓
- Benchmark: ~15-20% slower on CPU-bound operations ✓
- Integration: Same speed (I/O bound) ✓
- Single tool: Imperceptible difference ✓

If actual results match this analysis, M4 32GB is a solid choice.

## Cost-Benefit Summary

| Machine | Cost | Performance | Portability | Verdict |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **M4 Pro 64GB** | $2500 | Excellent (14c, 64GB) | OK (1.5kg) | Best all-around |
| **M4 32GB** | $1500 | Good (10c, 32GB) | Great (1.3kg) | Best for mobility |
| **M2 Air 24GB** | $1200 | Baseline (8c, 24GB) | Great (1.24kg) | Getting dated |

**The $1000 difference buys you:**
- 4 more CPU cores (14 vs 10)
- 32GB more RAM (64GB vs 32GB)
- ~15-20% faster test suite
- Maximum headroom for parallel workloads

**Whether that's worth it depends on your workflow.** Both machines are fast enough for OmniFocus MCP development.

## Historical Context

**M2 Air (from Oct 20 benchmark)**:
- Test suite: 106s
- Today's tasks (cold): 2700ms
- Full mode tags: 1100ms

**M4 Pro (current)**:
- Test suite: 22.4s (4.7x faster than M2!)
- Today's tasks (cold): 13,928ms (no difference - I/O bound)
- Full mode tags: 773ms (29% faster than M2)

**Both M4 and M4 Pro** are generational leaps forward. Even the "plain" M4 is excellent.

## Next Steps

1. **Get the M4 32GB** (or already have it?)
2. **Set it up** with same environment as M4 Pro
3. **Run the benchmark comparison** (see "How to Validate" section above)
4. **Compare actual times** to this analysis
5. **Make decision**: Keep M4 Pro as CI machine, or consolidate to M4?

**Question for you**: Do you already have the M4 32GB machine, or are you deciding whether to buy?
