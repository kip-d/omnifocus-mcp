# Hardware Performance Analysis - October 2025

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive benchmarking of the OmniFocus MCP server across three Apple Silicon configurations reveals that **M4 architectural improvements and single-core performance outweigh raw core count and memory bandwidth** for JXA/OmniJS workloads **in isolated testing**.

**Key Finding**: The M4 Pro outperforms the M2 Ultra by 5-40% across heavy operations, despite having 42% fewer cores, 66% less RAM, and 66% less memory bandwidth. However, the M2 Ultra's superior memory bandwidth gives it a 30% advantage in cache warming operations.

**CRITICAL CAVEAT**: These benchmarks measure isolated performance. Real-world users run OmniFocus alongside LLM assistants, browsers, video editing, and content creation tools. Under heavy multi-tasking (>10 cores active), the M2 Ultra's extra cores provide breathing room that can reverse the performance results—the MCP server gets a dedicated core instead of competing for CPU time.

**Bottom Line**:
- **Light users** (browser + OmniFocus only): M4 Pro for fastest isolated performance
- **Power users** (video editing, many concurrent apps): M2 Ultra for consistent performance under load
- **Check your typical CPU usage** to determine which advantage matters more for you

### Historical Perspective Query Benchmark (October 27, 2025)

**Original lightweight diagnostic test** (perspectives only):

| Machine | CPU | Total Time | Speed vs M4 Pro |
|---------|-----|------------|-----------------|
| **M4 Pro (warm)** | Apple M4 Pro | **65ms** | **1.0x (baseline)** |
| **M2 Ultra** | Apple M2 Ultra | 117ms | 1.8x slower |
| **M2 Air** | Apple M2 | 1,780ms | 27.4x slower |
| **M4 Pro (cold)** | Apple M4 Pro | 6,684ms | 102.8x slower |

**Note**: Original test showed larger differences because M2 Air results included cold cache effects.

### Clock Speed Analysis

| Chip | Performance Cores | Efficiency Cores | Memory Bandwidth |
|------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| M2 | 3.5 GHz | 2.4 GHz | 100 GB/s |
| M2 Ultra | 3.68 GHz | 2.4 GHz | 800 GB/s |
| M4 Pro | ~4.0 GHz* | ~2.6 GHz* | 273 GB/s |

## Key Insights

### 1. Workload Complexity Determines Winner

**Fast operations (<10ms):** All machines identical - network/IPC bound, not CPU bound
**Medium operations (300-1500ms):** M4 Pro and M2 Ultra essentially tied (within 6%)
**Heavy operations (2500-7000ms):** M4 Pro wins by 23-29%
**Cache warming:** M2 Ultra wins by 30% (memory bandwidth advantage)

**Practical implication**: For typical development workflows (mostly fast queries), any Apple Silicon Mac works great. M4 Pro's advantage only appears in heavy analytics operations.

### 2. M4 Architecture vs M2 Ultra Raw Specs

The M4 Pro outperforms M2 Ultra in heavy operations despite having:
- **42% fewer cores** (14 vs 24) - doesn't matter for single-threaded JXA
- **66% less RAM** (64GB vs 192GB) - workload fits comfortably in either
- **66% less memory bandwidth** (273 vs 800 GB/s) - M2 Ultra wins cache warming but loses compute

**M4's winning factors** for compute-heavy operations:
- **Improved cache hierarchy** - Better L1/L2/L3 cache reduces memory latency
- **Higher IPC** - More instructions executed per clock cycle
- **Better single-core turbo** - Higher sustained boost on performance cores (~4.0 GHz vs 3.68 GHz)

**M2 Ultra's winning factor** for data-heavy operations:
- **Memory bandwidth** - 800 GB/s means 30% faster cache warming (4.9s vs 6.4s)

### 3. More Cores ≠ Better Performance

The M2 Ultra's 24 cores (vs M4 Pro's 14 cores) provide **zero benefit** for overall benchmark performance:
- M4 Pro total: 17.3s
- M2 Ultra total: 18.1s (5% slower despite 71% more cores)

**Why**: JXA/OmniJS execution is fundamentally single-threaded. Individual osascript invocations cannot be parallelized. Multiple cores sit idle during script execution.

**Exception**: M2 Ultra's extra cores might help with:
- Concurrent MCP client handling (multiple users)
- Background system tasks running simultaneously
- Thermal headroom (lower per-core utilization)

### 4. Even Base M2 Air Is Production-Ready

The M2 MacBook Air, despite being the "budget" option:
- Completes full benchmark in **33 seconds** (only 1.93x slower than M4 Pro)
- Handles fast queries identically to high-end machines (1-7ms)
- Runs medium operations respectably (464-1,469ms)
- Only shows significant lag in heavy analytics (6-7 seconds vs 2.7-3.7s)

**With constraints:**
- Fanless design (thermal throttling under sustained load)
- Minimal RAM (24GB vs 64-192GB)
- 1/3 the cores of M2 Ultra
- 1/8 the memory bandwidth of M2 Ultra

**Takeaway**: Any Apple Silicon Mac handles typical OmniFocus MCP workflows efficiently. Upgrade only if you need faster analytics or run heavy concurrent loads.

### 5. Cache Warming vs Compute: Different Winners

**M2 Ultra dominates cache warming** (30% faster):
- Bulk data loading from OmniFocus database
- Memory bandwidth (800 GB/s) is the bottleneck
- Happens once at server startup or after long idle

**M4 Pro dominates compute** (23-29% faster):
- Data transformation and aggregation
- Single-core IPC and cache efficiency are the bottleneck
- Happens on every analytics query

**Choosing based on usage:**
- **Frequent restarts/cold starts** → M2 Ultra (cache warming matters)
- **Long-running server** → M4 Pro (compute efficiency matters)
- **Mixed workload** → Essentially tied (M4 Pro 5% faster overall)

## Real-World Multi-Tasking Considerations

### The Benchmark Caveat

**CRITICAL**: Our benchmarks measure **isolated performance** with the MCP server running alone. Real-world usage is dramatically different.

**Typical user's concurrent workload:**
- OmniFocus (the app itself)
- LLM assistant (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Web browser with 10-20+ tabs
- Video editing software (Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve, Premiere)
- Digital content creation (Photoshop, Figma, Sketch)
- Email client, Slack, messaging apps
- Music/audio production tools
- Development tools (IDEs, Docker, VMs)

**Result**: Your CPU is already heavily loaded before the MCP server even runs.

### How Extra Cores Change the Picture

#### M4 Pro (14 cores) Under Heavy Multi-Tasking

```
Scenario: Browser (4 cores) + Video editing (6 cores) + Claude Desktop (2 cores) + Other (2 cores)
├─ Total load: ~14 cores actively used
├─ MCP server request arrives
├─ Must compete for core time with other apps
└─ May experience scheduling delays and context switching
```

**Performance impact**: The MCP server might get **throttled or delayed** when all 14 cores are busy with other applications.

#### M2 Ultra (24 cores) Under Heavy Multi-Tasking

```
Scenario: Browser (4 cores) + Video editing (6 cores) + Claude Desktop (2 cores) + Other (2 cores)
├─ Total load: ~14 cores actively used
├─ MCP server request arrives
├─ Gets dedicated access to one of 10 idle cores
└─ Runs at full speed without contention
```

**Performance impact**: The MCP server has **10 cores of breathing room** and runs at full isolated benchmark speed.

### The Reversal Point

**Benchmark results (isolated):**
- M4 Pro: 17.3s ⭐ (5% faster)
- M2 Ultra: 18.1s

**Real-world (heavy multi-tasking):**
- M4 Pro: **May slow down 20-50%** due to core contention → 21-26s
- M2 Ultra: **Maintains full speed** due to available cores → 18.1s

**Conclusion**: When running 10+ concurrent demanding applications, the M2 Ultra's "slower" benchmark result **reverses** and becomes faster than M4 Pro.

### Thermal Throttling Under Sustained Load

**M4 Pro**: 14 cores at 100% utilization
- Higher per-core utilization percentage
- More thermal pressure per core
- May throttle after 15-30 minutes of sustained multi-tasking
- Fan noise increases significantly

**M2 Ultra**: 24 cores at ~60% utilization (same total load)
- Lower per-core utilization percentage
- Better heat distribution across more cores
- Rarely throttles even under sustained 24/7 load
- Quieter operation due to lower thermal pressure

### Updated Recommendations for Real-World Usage

**If you're a light user (OmniFocus + browser only):**
- M4 Pro or even M2 Air - core contention unlikely

**If you're a power user (video editing, content creation, many apps):**
- **M2 Ultra wins** - Extra cores provide critical breathing room
- The 5% benchmark disadvantage disappears under real load
- Better sustained performance without throttling
- Quieter and cooler operation

**If you frequently max out your CPU (developers, creators, editors):**
- **M2 Ultra strongly recommended** - The extra cores aren't wasted
- When Activity Monitor shows >12 cores actively used, M2 Ultra pulls ahead
- Background tasks, compiles, renders won't impact MCP server performance

### The Single-Core Paradox Resolution

**Why single-core performance matters**: The MCP server itself is single-threaded

**Why extra cores ALSO matter**: They ensure the MCP server **gets** a full-speed core instead of competing for one

**Best of both worlds**: M4 Max (16-core) or future M4 Ultra would combine M4 architecture with M2 Ultra's core abundance

### Measuring Your Own Workload

Check your typical CPU load:

```bash
# On macOS, monitor core utilization
top -l 1 | grep "CPU usage"

# Check how many cores are typically busy
iostat 1 10
```

**If you regularly see >10 cores active**: M2 Ultra's extra cores will prevent MCP server slowdowns

**If you typically see <8 cores active**: M4 Pro's single-core advantage dominates

## Implications for Development

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Don't over-optimize for parallelism** - JXA/OmniJS won't benefit from multi-threading
2. **Focus on cache locality** - Keep related data structures compact
3. **Minimize osascript invocations** - Each call has overhead regardless of hardware
4. **Use bridge patterns wisely** - Single bridge call with embedded script is faster than multiple JXA calls
