# Test Cleanup Guide

## Problem: Database Pollution from Integration Tests

Integration tests that create OmniFocus tasks and projects were leaving behind test data after test runs, polluting the database with orphaned test items.

### Root Cause

In `omnifocus-4.7-features.test.ts`, 12 calls to `client.callTool('manage_task', { operation: 'create', ... })` were creating tasks directly without:

1. Adding tracking tags (session ID and `'mcp-test'` tag)
2. Recording task IDs in `createdTaskIds[]`
3. Notifying the cleanup system about the created items

**Result**: The `afterEach()` and `afterAll()` cleanup hooks couldn't find these tasks because they weren't in the tracking array.

### Evidence

Tasks with these tag combinations were found in OmniFocus after test runs:
- `['test', 'planned-dates']`
- `['test', 'planned-query']`
- `['test', 'planned-update']`
- And 9 more similar combinations

All created by direct `callTool()` calls that bypassed tracking.

---

## Solution: Cleanup Tracking Helpers

### New Methods in MCPTestClient

Two helper methods were added to track items created via direct `callTool()` calls:

```typescript
/**
 * Track a task created via client.callTool('manage_task', { operation: 'create', ... })
 * Ensures the task will be cleaned up in afterEach/afterAll hooks
 */
trackCreatedTaskId(result: any): void {
  if (result?.success && result?.data?.task?.taskId) {
    this.createdTaskIds.push(result.data.task.taskId);
  }
}

/**
 * Track a project created via client.callTool('projects', { operation: 'create', ... })
 * Ensures the project will be cleaned up in afterEach/afterAll hooks
 */
trackCreatedProjectId(result: any): void {
  if (result?.success && result?.data?.project?.project?.id) {
    this.createdProjectIds.push(result.data.project.project.id);
  }
}
```

**Location**: `tests/integration/helpers/mcp-test-client.ts:252-268`

### How to Use

When creating items via direct `callTool()` calls, immediately track the result:

#### ❌ BEFORE (Untracked - pollutes database)
```typescript
const response = await client.callTool('manage_task', {
  operation: 'create',
  name: 'Task with Planned Date',
  plannedDate: '2025-11-15 09:00',
  tags: ['test', 'planned-dates']
});
// Task created but NOT tracked - will remain in database after test!
```

#### ✅ AFTER (Tracked - cleaned up automatically)
```typescript
const response = await client.callTool('manage_task', {
  operation: 'create',
  name: 'Task with Planned Date',
  plannedDate: '2025-11-15 09:00',
  tags: ['test', 'planned-dates']
});
client.trackCreatedTaskId(response);  // Add this line!
// Task now tracked and will be deleted in afterEach/afterAll
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Helper Methods When Possible

**Preferred**: Use `createTestTask()` and `createTestProject()` helpers - they track automatically:

```typescript
// ✅ BEST - Automatic tracking with session ID
const result = await client.createTestTask('My Task', {
  plannedDate: '2025-11-15',
  tags: ['test', 'my-feature']
});
// Automatically tracked, tagged with mcp-test + session ID, cleaned up
```

### 2. Track Immediately After Creation

When you must use direct `callTool()` calls, track immediately:

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Track immediately
const response = await client.callTool('manage_task', {
  operation: 'create',
  name: 'Task',
  tags: ['test']
});
if (response.success) {
  client.trackCreatedTaskId(response);
}
```

### 3. Check for Success Before Tracking

Always verify the operation succeeded:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Check success first
const response = await client.callTool('manage_task', { operation: 'create', ... });
if (response.success && response.data?.task?.taskId) {
  client.trackCreatedTaskId(response);
}

// ❌ WRONG - Blindly track without checking
client.trackCreatedTaskId(response); // What if it failed?
```

## Cleanup Execution Flow

### Per-Test Cleanup (afterEach)

```typescript
afterEach(async () => {
  await client.quickCleanup();
});
```

**What it does**:
1. Gets the list of tracked task IDs
2. Uses `bulk_delete` operation to delete all tasks at once (fast!)
3. Individually deletes tracked projects
4. Clears the tracking arrays for next test
5. Logs performance metrics

**Performance**: ~5 seconds for 12 tracked tasks

### Final Cleanup (afterAll)

```typescript
afterAll(async () => {
  await client.thoroughCleanup();
});
```

**What it does**:
1. Performs bulk delete of tracked tasks (same as `quickCleanup`)
2. Individually deletes tracked projects
3. (Optionally) scans for any remaining test data by tag

**Benefits**: Acts as paranoid safety net for tests that fail before reaching `afterEach`

## Migration of omnifocus-4.7-features.test.ts

All 12 direct `callTool('manage_task', ...)` calls were updated to call `trackCreatedTaskId()`:

### Example Transformation

**Before**:
```typescript
it('should create task with planned date', async () => {
  const response = await client.callTool('manage_task', {
    operation: 'create',
    name: 'Task with Planned Date',
    plannedDate: '2025-11-15 09:00',
    tags: ['test', 'planned-dates']
  });
  expect(response.success).toBe(true);
  expect(response.data?.task?.taskId).toBeDefined();
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
it('should create task with planned date', async () => {
  const response = await client.callTool('manage_task', {
    operation: 'create',
    name: 'Task with Planned Date',
    plannedDate: '2025-11-15 09:00',
    tags: ['test', 'planned-dates']
  });
  expect(response.success).toBe(true);
  expect(response.data?.task?.taskId).toBeDefined();
  client.trackCreatedTaskId(response);  // ← ADDED
});
```

### Modified Tests

In `omnifocus-4.7-features.test.ts`:
1. Line 47: `should create task with planned date` ✅
2. Line 60: `should list tasks with planned date included` ✅
3. Line 91: `should update task with new planned date` ✅
4. Line 113: `should clear planned date when set to null` ✅
5. Line 239: `should create task with user-friendly repeat intent` ✅
6. Line 257: `should support repeat intent with when-marked-done anchor` ✅
7. Line 278: `should create task with end date for repeat rule` ✅
8. Line 309: `should support version-aware feature queries` ✅
9. Line 343: `should create complex task with all 4.7+ features` ✅
10. Line 361: `should query tasks with all 4.7+ properties` ✅

## Cleanup Status After Fix

### Now Properly Cleaned Up

✅ **data-lifecycle.test.ts** (6 tests)
- Uses `createTestTask()` and `createTestProject()` helpers
- Tracked with session ID and `'mcp-test'` tag
- Cleaned up in `afterEach()` and `afterAll()`

✅ **omnifocus-4.7-features.test.ts** (15 tests)
- Now uses `client.trackCreatedTaskId()` for all direct creates
- Cleaned up in `afterEach()` and `afterAll()`
- Database pollution issue **RESOLVED**

✅ **batch-operations.test.ts** (8 skipped tests)
- Has custom cleanup code in `afterAll()`
- Cleans up via direct OmniAutomation script execution
- Will be cleaned up when test is enabled

### Read-Only Tests (No Cleanup Needed)

- **mcp-protocol.test.ts** - No data creation
- **edge-case-escaping.test.ts** - No data creation
- **pattern-analysis-tool.test.ts** - No data creation

---

## Testing the Fix

### Run Integration Tests

```bash
# Run only integration tests that create data
npm test -- tests/integration/omnifocus-4.7-features.test.ts tests/integration/data-lifecycle.test.ts

# Verify cleanup by checking OmniFocus:
# Before fix: Tasks with tags ['test', 'planned-dates'] would remain
# After fix: Tasks are automatically deleted by quickCleanup()
```

### Verify Cleanup Logs

The cleanup output shows:
```
🧹 Quick cleanup: deleting 12 tasks, 0 projects
📊 Quick cleanup completed in 5234ms (12 operations)
```

Each test run should show tasks being deleted. If you see "0 tasks deleted", no test data was created (which is also good!).

## Best Practices Summary

| Scenario | Method | Cleanup | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| Normal test data | `createTestTask()` | Automatic ✅ | Always use this when possible |
| Custom properties | `callTool()` + `trackCreatedTaskId()` | Automatic ✅ | Track immediately after create |
| Complex operations | Direct script execution | Manual | Provide custom `afterAll()` hook |
| Read-only tests | No creation needed | N/A | Skip cleanup entirely |

## Troubleshooting

### "Tests create tasks but cleanup doesn't run"

**Cause**: `afterEach()` or `afterAll()` not being called
**Solution**: Check test framework setup - ensure hooks are registered
**Verify**: Add console.log in cleanup hook and run test

### "Some tasks remain after cleanup"

**Cause**: Task created but not tracked
**Solution**: Add `client.trackCreatedTaskId(response)` after creation
**Verify**: Check if tracking ID is being recorded in logs

### "Cleanup is slow (> 10 seconds)"

**Cause**: Too many individual delete operations
**Solution**: Bulk delete is already optimized - timeout may be legitimate
**Verify**: Run with `--reporter=verbose` to see timing breakdown
