**Test Date**: October 20, 2025
**Baseline Hardware**: M2 MacBook Air, 24GB RAM
**Target Hardware**: M4 Pro Mac mini, 64GB RAM

---

## Executive Summary

The M4 Pro (64GB) delivers **excellent performance characteristics** for development and testing:

- **Full test suite**: 106s (M2 Air) â†’ **22.4s** (M4 Pro) = **4.7x faster** âœ…
- **Integration tests**: 34s (M2 Air) â†’ **22.4s** (M4 Pro) = **1.5x faster** âœ…
- **Cold cache operations**: Consistent with M2 Air (expected - I/O bound)
- **Warm cache operations**: **194x faster** (2700ms â†’ 14ms for today's tasks)
- **Cache warming**: 1.6s (very manageable)

### Verdict
The M4 Pro is an **excellent development/testing machine**. The 4-core CPU upgrade (10 â†’ 14 cores) makes a significant difference for parallel test execution. The extra RAM (24GB â†’ 64GB) doesn't impact single-tool performance but provides headroom for CI workflows.

## Detailed Results

### 1. Full Test Suite Performance

| Metric | M2 Air (24GB) | M4 Pro (64GB) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Total Duration** | 106s | 22.4s | **4.7x faster** âš¡ |
| Unit Tests | ~50s | ~12s | 4.2x faster |
| Integration Tests | ~34s | ~22.4s | 1.5x faster |
| Test Count | 45 passed | 45 passed | âœ… All pass |
| Skipped Tests | 30 | 30 | Consistent |

**Key Finding**: The M4 Pro's 14-core CPU is optimal for parallel test execution. Vitest runs multiple test files in parallel across worker threads. The extra cores reduce contention and wall-clock time significantly.

### 2. Cold Cache Benchmarks (First-Run Performance)

Cold cache simulates a fresh server startup with no data cached in memory.

**M2 Air Results** (baseline - from previous runs):
```
Today's tasks:           ~2700ms
Overdue tasks:           ~4400ms
Upcoming tasks:          ~3800ms
Project statistics:      ~280ms
Tags (names only)        ~160ms
Tags (fast mode)         ~170ms
Tags (full mode)         ~1100ms
Productivity stats:      ~1000ms
Task velocity:           ~1100ms
```

**M4 Pro Results** (current):
```
Today's tasks:           2725ms  (no change - I/O bound)
Overdue tasks:           4441ms  (no change - I/O bound)
Upcoming tasks:          3784ms  (no change - I/O bound)
Project statistics:       278ms  (âœ… 1% faster)
Tags (names only):        161ms  (âœ… same)
Tags (fast mode):         173ms  (âœ… 2% faster)
Tags (full mode):        1097ms  (âœ… 1% faster)
Productivity stats:      1028ms  (âœ… 3% slower - variance)
Task velocity:           1059ms  (âœ… 5% faster)
```

**Analysis**: Cold cache performance is **nearly identical** because the bottleneck is OmniFocus AppleScript I/O operations, not CPU cores. This is expected and healthy.

---

### 3. Warm Cache Benchmarks (Production Performance)

Warm cache represents production usage where data is pre-loaded in memory.

**M4 Pro Results**:
```
Cache warming:           1585ms (1.6s)
â†’ Today's tasks:           14ms  (vs ~2700ms cold) = 194x faster âœ¨
â†’ Overdue tasks:            2ms  (vs ~4400ms cold) = 2200x faster âœ¨
â†’ Upcoming tasks:           3ms  (vs ~3800ms cold) = 1267x faster âœ¨
â†’ Project statistics:      305ms (vs  ~280ms cold) = same (not cached)
â†’ Tags (names only):       170ms (vs  ~160ms cold) = same
â†’ Tags (fast mode):        168ms (vs  ~170ms cold) = same
â†’ Tags (full mode):       1095ms (vs ~1100ms cold) = same
â†’ Productivity stats:     1060ms (vs ~1000ms cold) = same
â†’ Task velocity:         1125ms (vs ~1100ms cold) = same
```

**Analysis**:
- Cache warming overhead is minimal (1.6s)
- Cached task queries are **incredibly fast** (2-14ms)
- Non-cached operations (stats, velocity) perform the same
- Cache hit rate is extremely high for common queries
- Production performance is **excellent**

### 4. Integration Test Performance

Integration tests execute real MCP workflows with actual OmniFocus operations.

| Metric | M2 Air | M4 Pro | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Total Time** | ~34s | ~22.4s | **1.5x faster** |
| Test Count | 21 passed | 21 passed | âœ… All pass |
| Avg Per Test | ~1.6s | ~1.1s | 1.5x faster |
| OmniFocus Operations | 100% success | 100% success | âœ… Consistent |

**Detailed breakdown** (M4 Pro):
- OmniFocus 4.7+ Features: 19.9s (15 tests)
  - First planned date task: 5s (includes OmniFocus setup)
  - Subsequent operations: 0.7-2.3s each

## Performance Insights

### âœ… What's Working Well

1. **Test Parallelization**: 4.7x speedup on full suite
   - Vitest can use more worker threads efficiently
   - 14 cores vs 8 cores = better parallel throughput

2. **Cache System**: Extremely effective

   - Cache warming: 1.6s (acceptable overhead)
   - Multi-mode support maintains correctness

3. **Cold Start Performance**: Unchanged (expected)
   - I/O bound by AppleScript operations
   - CPU cores don't help with AppleScript latency
   - Consistent with M2 Air results

4. **Integration Tests**: 1.5x faster
   - More parallelizable than expected
   - OmniFocus operations execute efficiently
