## 10 Evaluation Questions

### Question 1: Project Review Management
**Question**: Query all active projects and identify which one has the most overdue review date. What is the project name?
**Expected Answer**: `Westgate`
**Tools Required**: `projects` (list operation)
**Complexity**: Medium - Requires parsing review dates and comparing timestamps

### Question 2: Project Inventory Analysis
**Question**: Using the projects tool, list all projects and identify how many are completely empty with zero tasks.
**Expected Answer**: `4`
**Tools Required**: `projects` (list operation with task count filtering)
**Complexity**: Medium - Requires filtering and counting

### Question 3: Task Counting
**Question**: Query all tasks assigned to the "Pending Purchase Orders" project and count the total number of tasks in that project.
**Expected Answer**: `44`
**Tools Required**: `tasks` (query with project filter)
**Complexity**: Easy - Straightforward counting

### Question 4: Task Availability Analysis
**Question**: Among tasks in the "Pending Purchase Orders" project, how many are in an available state (not blocked by dependencies)?
**Expected Answer**: `41`
**Tools Required**: `tasks` (query with project and availability filters)
**Complexity**: Medium - Requires understanding task state filters

### Question 5: Workflow Constraint Detection
**Question**: Find all projects with a sequential workflow constraint enabled. Name the first sequential project found.
**Expected Answer**: `Blank Order Project`
**Tools Required**: `projects` (list with sequential property inspection)
**Complexity**: Medium - Requires understanding project workflow types

### Question 6: High-Priority Task Identification
**Question**: Query for all overdue tasks and identify how many of them are marked as flagged (high priority).
**Expected Answer**: `2`
**Tools Required**: `tasks` (mode=overdue with flagged filter)
**Complexity**: Medium - Combines multiple filters

### Question 7: Task Distribution Analysis
**Question**: Group overdue tasks by project and identify which project has the most overdue tasks.
**Expected Answer**: `Pending Purchase Orders`
**Tools Required**: `tasks` (mode=overdue), aggregation logic
**Complexity**: High - Requires grouping and analysis

### Question 8: Critical Task Finding
**Question**: Using task and project queries, what is the name of the highest priority flagged task that is overdue?
**Expected Answer**: `Call Kurzweil support regarding the Cyber security course`
**Tools Required**: `tasks` (mode=overdue with flagged filter, sorting)
**Complexity**: High - Requires multi-step filtering and prioritization

### Question 9: Project Status Query
**Question**: Query projects with empty status and find how many projects are currently on hold.
**Expected Answer**: `1`
**Tools Required**: `projects` (list with status filter)
**Complexity**: Easy - Status filtering

### Question 10: Project History Analysis
**Question**: Analyze the projects list and identify the project that has not been modified since earliest date but still contains active tasks. What is its name?
**Expected Answer**: `Blank Order Project`
**Tools Required**: `projects` (detailed list with modification dates and task counts)
**Complexity**: High - Requires synthesis of multiple data points

## Evaluation Methodology

### Data Validation
All expected answers were verified by querying actual OmniFocus data through the MCP server:

✅ **Verified Answers**:
- Q1: Westgate (last review: 2018-07-19 - over 7 years overdue)
- Q2: 4 empty projects identified
- Q3: 44 total tasks in "Pending Purchase Orders"
- Q4: 41 available tasks (3 blocked/dependent)
- Q5: Blank Order Project is sequential
- Q6: 2 overdue + flagged tasks found
- Q7: "Pending Purchase Orders" has most overdue (4+)
- Q8: "Call Kurzweil support..." is flagged & overdue
- Q9: 1 project on hold
- Q10: Blank Order Project (last modified 2007-11-30)

### Real Data Insights
The evaluation leverages real patterns in the test OmniFocus database:

**Workflow Issues Identified**:
1. **Review Backlog**: All projects have overdue reviews
2. **Stale Projects**: Multiple projects with 10+ year old last modifications
3. **Blocked Tasks**: Sequential projects with dependent tasks
4. **Overdue Tasks**: At least 4 tasks in "Pending Purchase Orders" are overdue
5. **Priority Items**: 2 tasks are both flagged and overdue

## Running the Evaluation

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build the MCP server
npm run build

# Create evaluation harness script
python3 << 'EOF'
import subprocess
import json

# Start MCP server
proc = subprocess.Popen(
    ["node", "dist/index.js"],
    stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
    text=True
)

# Send initialization
init = {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "initialize",
    "params": {
        "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
        "capabilities": {},
        "clientInfo": {"name": "eval", "version": "1.0"}
    }
}

proc.stdin.write(json.dumps(init) + "\n")
proc.stdin.flush()

# Read response
print(proc.stdout.readline())
proc.stdin.close()
EOF
```

### Full Evaluation with Claude
```bash
# Use the MCP evaluation framework (requires Python + Anthropic SDK)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key

python3 << 'EOF'
from anthropic import Anthropic
import subprocess
import json

# Run evaluation with Claude
# See RUNNING_EVALUATIONS.md for detailed instructions
EOF

- **Total execution time**: ~30-60 seconds for all 10 questions

### Success Indicators
✅ LLM accurately calls the right tools
✅ LLM correctly interprets tool responses
✅ LLM properly handles pagination/limits
✅ LLM understands filter combinations
✅ LLM synthesizes data across tools

### Common Failure Points
❌ Misunderstanding filter syntax (e.g., "available" vs "blocked")
❌ Confusion between project status and task status
❌ Difficulty with large response sets
❌ Timestamp comparison errors
❌ Missing aggregation/sorting logic
