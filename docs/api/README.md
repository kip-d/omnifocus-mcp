# API Reference Documentation

Complete API specifications for the OmniFocus MCP server. We maintain three versions optimized for different use cases:

## API Reference Versions

### **API-REFERENCE-V2.md** - Main Developer Reference
Comprehensive specification of all tools, parameters, return values, and error codes. Use this when:
- Implementing against the API
- Debugging tool call failures
- Understanding complete parameter schemas
- Learning about all available options and modes

**Best for:** Implementation, detailed specifications, complete reference

### **API-REFERENCE-LLM.md** - Claude Desktop Instructions Version
Optimized for Claude Desktop's Instructions feature. This version is designed to be loaded into Claude's system prompt to improve how the AI assistant uses your tools.

**Use this by:**
1. Opening Claude Desktop
2. Going to Settings â†’ Developer
3. Loading this document into the Instructions/System Prompt section

**Benefits:** Better tool selection, fewer errors, more natural task completion

**Best for:** Improving Claude's understanding of your tools

### **API-COMPACT.md** - Context Window Optimized
Ultra-compact version for use in scenarios with limited token budgets. Includes essential information while minimizing token usage (~30% of full reference).

**Use this when:**
- Embedding API docs in limited-context scenarios
- Working with smaller AI models with tight context windows
- Creating custom system prompts with strict token limits

**Best for:** Token efficiency, embedded scenarios, resource-constrained environments
