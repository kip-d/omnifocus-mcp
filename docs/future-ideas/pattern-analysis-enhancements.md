# Pattern Analysis Enhancements

This document tracks unimplemented pattern analysis features that could be added to enhance the `pattern_analysis` tool.

## Status Update (October 2025)

### ✅ Completed - GTD Power User Suite
Implemented in v2.3.0:
- ✅ Review Gaps Analysis (Priority 2) - `review_gaps` pattern
- ✅ Next Actions Clarity (Priority 3) - `next_actions` pattern
- ✅ WIP Limits (Priority 6) - `wip_limits` pattern
- ✅ Due-Date Bunching (Priority 5) - `due_date_bunching` pattern

All four analyzers are now integrated into the `analyze_patterns` tool with configurable options.

### ⏸️ Deferred
Remaining from original list:
- Estimation Bias (Priority 1)
- Tag Entropy & Synonym Detection (Priority 4)
- Task Dependency Analysis (Priority 7)
- Context Switching Analysis (Priority 8)
- Hierarchical Summarization (Priority 9)
- Vector Embeddings (Priority 10)

## Near-Term Patterns (From Original Branch)

These patterns were implemented in the `pattern-analysis` branch but not yet ported to v2.0.0:

### 1. Estimation Bias Analysis
**Purpose**: Compare estimated vs actual task completion times to identify planning accuracy
**Implementation**:
- Compare `estimatedMinutes` with time between creation and completion
- Identify consistent over/under-estimation patterns
- Group by project or tag to find areas needing better estimates

### 2. Next Actions Clarity
**Purpose**: Analyze task names for GTD best practices
**Implementation**:
- Check for clear action verbs (e.g., "Call", "Write", "Review")
- Flag vague tasks (e.g., "Project X", "Mom", "Ideas")
- Identify tasks missing context or unclear outcomes
- Score tasks on actionability

### 3. Review Cadence Gaps
**Purpose**: Find projects overdue for GTD weekly review
**Implementation**:
- Check `nextReviewDate` and `lastReviewDate` on projects
- Identify projects never reviewed
- Calculate average review intervals
- Flag projects with inconsistent review patterns

## Advanced Patterns (From Blueprint)

These conceptual ideas from the original blueprint represent more sophisticated analysis:

### 4. Tag Entropy & Synonym Detection
**Purpose**: Identify redundant or overlapping tags
**Implementation Ideas**:
- Use string similarity to find near-duplicate tags
- Analyze tag co-occurrence to find always-paired tags
- Identify hierarchical relationships between tags
- Suggest tag consolidation opportunities

### 5. Due-Date Bunching Analysis
**Purpose**: Detect workload imbalances and bottlenecks
**Implementation Ideas**:
- Analyze distribution of due dates
- Identify days/weeks with excessive commitments
- Calculate sustainable daily task completion rates
- Suggest deadline redistribution

### 6. WIP (Work-In-Progress) Limits
**Purpose**: Identify when too many tasks are in progress
**Implementation Ideas**:
- Count tasks in "available" state per project
- Compare against configurable WIP limits
- Identify projects with too many parallel tasks
- Suggest sequential ordering for overloaded projects

### 7. Task Dependency Analysis
**Purpose**: Find hidden dependencies and blocking patterns
**Implementation Ideas**:
- Analyze task names for dependency keywords ("after", "when", "waiting for")
- Build dependency graphs from task relationships
- Identify circular dependencies or long chains
- Highlight critical path tasks

### 8. Context Switching Analysis
**Purpose**: Measure context switching overhead
**Implementation Ideas**:
- Analyze task completion patterns by tag/project
- Identify rapid switches between different contexts
- Calculate "focus time" on single projects/areas
- Suggest batching strategies

## Technical Enhancements (From Blueprint)

### 9. Hierarchical Summarization
**Purpose**: Handle databases too large for single analysis pass
**Implementation**:
- Map-reduce pattern for large datasets
- Project-level summaries aggregated to area level
- Area summaries combined for portfolio view
- Progressive detail drilling

### 10. Vector Embeddings for Similarity
**Purpose**: More sophisticated duplicate/similarity detection
**Implementation Ideas**:
- Generate embeddings for task names/notes
- Use cosine similarity for better matching
- Cluster related tasks across projects
- Find conceptually similar (not just textually similar) tasks

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Quick Wins)
1. Estimation Bias - Valuable for planning improvement
2. Review Gaps - Core GTD practice
3. Next Actions Clarity - Improves task actionability

### Medium Priority (Moderate Effort)
4. Tag Entropy - Helps maintain clean taxonomy
5. Due-Date Bunching - Prevents overcommitment
6. WIP Limits - Improves focus

### Low Priority (Complex/Experimental)
7. Dependency Analysis - Requires relationship mapping
8. Context Switching - Needs completion history analysis
9. Hierarchical Summarization - For very large databases
10. Vector Embeddings - Requires ML infrastructure

## Notes

- Current implementation handles 5 patterns: duplicates, dormant_projects, tag_audit, deadline_health, waiting_for
- Performance consideration: Each pattern adds processing time
- Consider optional pattern groups (basic, advanced, experimental)
- Some patterns may require additional data collection over time
