# Smart Capture: Meeting Notes → OmniFocus Tasks

Extract action items from unstructured text (meeting notes, transcripts, emails) and convert them into structured OmniFocus tasks and projects.

## Overview

The `parse_meeting_notes` tool analyzes text and automatically:
- **Extracts action items** - Identifies tasks from natural language
- **Detects projects** - Recognizes multi-step work as projects
- **Suggests context tags** - Auto-assigns @computer, @phone, @15min, @urgent, etc.
- **Parses due dates** - Converts "by Friday" → YYYY-MM-DD
- **Estimates duration** - Predicts task time based on keywords
- **Identifies assignees** - Creates tags like @john, @waiting-for-sarah, @agenda-bob
- **Matches to existing projects** - Links tasks to your current projects

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Extract and preview
{
  input: "Meeting notes: Send proposal by Friday. Call Sarah tomorrow.",
  returnFormat: "preview"
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "extracted": {
    "tasks": [
      {
        "tempId": "task_1",
        "name": "Send proposal",
        "suggestedTags": ["@computer", "@30min"],
        "suggestedDueDate": "2025-10-05",
        "confidence": "high"
      },
      {
        "tempId": "task_2",
        "name": "Call Sarah",
        "suggestedTags": ["@phone", "@30min", "@sarah"],
        "suggestedDueDate": "2025-10-02",
        "confidence": "high"
      }
    ]
  },
  "summary": {
    "totalTasks": 2,
    "highConfidence": 2
  }
}
```

### Direct Creation

```javascript
// Format for batch_create
{
  input: "...",
  returnFormat: "batch_ready"
}

// Then use batch_create
batch_create({ items: result.batchItems })
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Meeting Notes

```
Meeting: Q4 Planning
- John to send quarterly report by Friday
- Website redesign project: wireframes, development, testing
- Waiting on budget approval from Sarah
- Follow up with client next Tuesday
```

**Extracted:**
- 3 projects with subtasks
- 2 standalone tasks
- Tags: @john, @waiting-for-sarah, @computer
- Due dates parsed from "by Friday", "next Tuesday"

### 2. Email Action Items

```
Hi team,

Quick summary from today's call:
- Send proposal to Acme Corp (urgent!)
- Review Q4 budget numbers
- Schedule demo for next week

Thanks!
```

**Extracted:**
- 3 tasks
- Tags: @urgent, @computer, @30min
- Due date: "next week" → calculated date

### 3. Voice Notes / Transcripts

```
I need to call the client about the proposal
then update the pricing doc
and send it by end of week
also ask Bob about timeline
```

**Extracted:**
- 4 sequential tasks
- Tags: @phone, @computer, @agenda-bob
- Due date: "end of week" → Friday

## Context Tag Detection

The tool auto-suggests tags based on content:

### Location Tags
- `@computer` - email, code, document, write, research
- `@phone` - call, contact, discuss
- `@office` - meeting, in-person, presentation
- `@home` - personal, household
- `@errands` - buy, pick up, shop, store
- `@anywhere` - think about, consider

### Time Estimate Tags
- `@15min` - quick, brief, short
- `@30min` - call, review, check
- `@1hour` - meeting, discussion
- `@deep-work` - plan, design, analyze, write

### Priority Tags
- `@urgent` - asap, urgent, critical, immediately
- `@important` - must, essential, required
- `@someday` - maybe, eventually, consider

### People Tags
- `@{name}` - "[Name] to..." (assignee)
- `@waiting-for-{name}` - "Waiting for [Name]"
- `@agenda-{name}` - "Ask/Discuss with [Name]"

## Natural Language Date Parsing

Supported date formats:

- `today` → current date
- `tomorrow` → next day
- `Monday`, `Tuesday`, etc. → next occurrence
- `next week` → +7 days
- `this week` / `end of week` → next Friday
- `end of month` → last day of current month

**Date phrases:**
- "by Friday" → due date
- "after Monday" → defer date
- "follow up next Tuesday" → defer date
- "before end of week" → due date - 1 day

## Duration Estimation

Automatic time estimates based on keywords:

| Keyword Pattern | Estimate |
|----------------|----------|
| quick, brief, short | 15 minutes |
| call, phone, review | 30 minutes |
| meeting, discussion | 1 hour |
| write, create, design | 1.5 hours |
| plan, analyze, research | 2 hours |
| deep work, focus | 3 hours |

## Project Detection

The tool identifies projects by:

1. **Explicit markers**: "Project:", "includes:", "involves:"
2. **Sequential steps**: "then", "after that", "followed by"
3. **Multiple tasks**: Grouped under headers

**Example:**
```
Website Redesign project:
- Review analytics
- Create wireframes
- User testing
```

**Result:** 1 project with 3 subtasks

## Parameters

### Required
- `input` (string) - Meeting notes, transcript, or text to parse

### Optional

**Extraction Control:**
- `extractMode` - What to extract: `"action_items"`, `"projects"`, or `"both"` (default)
- `returnFormat` - Output format: `"preview"` (default) or `"batch_ready"`

**Smart Suggestions:**
- `suggestProjects` (boolean, default: true) - Match to existing projects
- `suggestTags` (boolean, default: true) - Suggest context tags
- `suggestDueDates` (boolean, default: true) - Extract due dates
- `suggestEstimates` (boolean, default: true) - Estimate duration

**Output Control:**
- `groupByProject` (boolean, default: true) - Group tasks by project
- `existingProjects` (string[]) - Known project names for matching
- `defaultProject` (string) - Fallback project for unmatched items

## Confidence Scoring

Each extracted item gets a confidence score:

- **High** - Clear action verb + tags/dates + good length
- **Medium** - Some indicators but missing context
- **Low** - Ambiguous or minimal information

Use `needsReview` in summary to identify low-confidence items.

## Integration with batch_create

The tool outputs batch-ready format compatible with `batch_create`:

```javascript
// Step 1: Extract
const result = await parse_meeting_notes({
  input: "...",
  returnFormat: "batch_ready"
});

// Step 2: Create (one call for everything)
await batch_create({
  items: result.batchItems,
  atomicOperation: true
});
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Structure Your Notes

**Good:**
```
Action Items:
- Send proposal by Friday
- Call client tomorrow
- Review budget next week
```

**Works But Less Optimal:**
```
We should probably send the proposal sometime soon and
maybe call the client if we get a chance and review budgets
```

### 2. Use Action Verbs

**Good:** Send, Call, Review, Update, Create, Schedule

**Avoid:** Maybe think about possibly doing something

### 3. Include Context

**Good:** "Send Q4 proposal to Acme Corp by Friday"

**Better:** Includes recipient, deadline, and specifics

### 4. Mark Assignees Clearly

**Good:**
- "John to send report"
- "Waiting for Sarah's approval"
- "Ask Bob about timeline"

### 5. Specify Dates

**Good:** "by Friday", "next Tuesday", "end of month"

**Avoid:** "soon", "later", "sometime"

## Examples

### Example 1: Sprint Planning

**Input:**
```
Sprint Planning - Week of Oct 1

High Priority:
- Complete user authentication (estimate: 3 days)
- Fix payment gateway bug (urgent!)
- Review security audit

Lower Priority:
- Update documentation
- Refactor database queries

Waiting On:
- Design mockups from Sarah
- API keys from DevOps
```

**Result:**
- 5 tasks
- Tags: @urgent, @deep-work, @computer, @waiting-for-sarah, @waiting-for-devops
- Estimates: 3hr (deep work), 30min (review), etc.

### Example 2: Client Meeting

**Input:**
```
Client Call with Acme Corp - Oct 1

Discussed:
- Q4 roadmap priorities
- Timeline concerns

Action Items:
- Send updated proposal by end of week

### Example 3: Project Kickoff

**Input:**
```
New Website Project Kickoff

Phase 1 - Research:
- Review current analytics
- User survey
- Competitor analysis

Phase 2 - Design:
- Wireframes
- Mockups
- Design system

Then development and testing
```

**Result:**
- 1 project: "New Website"
- 6 subtasks in sequential order
- Tags: @computer, @deep-work, @1hour

## Tips & Tricks

### Batch Multiple Meetings

Process multiple meetings in one go:

```javascript
const meetings = [
  "Meeting 1 notes: ...",
  "Meeting 2 notes: ...",
  "Meeting 3 notes: ..."
];

const allItems = [];
for (const meeting of meetings) {
  const result = await parse_meeting_notes({
    input: meeting,
    returnFormat: "batch_ready"
  });
  allItems.push(...result.batchItems);
}

// Create all at once
await batch_create({ items: allItems });
```

### Match to Existing Projects

If you have consistent project names:

```javascript
await parse_meeting_notes({
  input: "Update Client Onboarding documentation",
  existingProjects: ["Client Onboarding", "Documentation"],
  defaultProject: "Miscellaneous"
});
```

Result: Task matched to "Client Onboarding" project

### Review Before Creating

Always use preview mode first:

```javascript
// 1. Preview
const preview = await parse_meeting_notes({
  input: "...",
  returnFormat: "preview"
});

// 2. Review extracted items
console.log(preview.summary);
console.log(preview.extracted.tasks);

// 3. If good, get batch_ready format
const batch = await parse_meeting_notes({
  input: "...",  // same input
  returnFormat: "batch_ready"
});

// 4. Create
await batch_create({ items: batch.batchItems });
```

## Limitations

### What It Can't Do

1. **Complete tasks for you** - Only the user can mark physical tasks complete
2. **Make project decisions** - Tool suggests, user confirms
3. **Handle complex logic** - "If X then Y" requires manual review
4. **Understand context** - Needs explicit action verbs and dates

### When to Review Manually

- Low confidence items (`needsReview` array)
- Ambiguous assignees
- Complex multi-step dependencies
- Sensitive or critical tasks

## Troubleshooting

### No Tasks Extracted

**Cause:** No action verbs found

**Fix:** Add action verbs (Send, Call, Review, Update, etc.)

### Wrong Tags Suggested

**Cause:** Keyword matching is imperfect

**Fix:** Review tags in preview mode before creating

### Dates Not Parsed

**Cause:** Unsupported date format

**Fix:** Use supported formats (today, Friday, next week, etc.)

### Tasks Not Grouped

**Cause:** Project indicators not detected

**Fix:** Use "Project:", headers, or explicit multi-step indicators
