# Pattern Analysis Tool Guide

The `analyze_patterns` tool provides database-wide insights by detecting patterns, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement across your entire OmniFocus system.

## Overview

This tool analyzes your tasks and projects to identify:
- Duplicate or near-duplicate tasks
- Dormant projects that haven't been updated
- Tag usage patterns and inefficiencies
- Deadline clustering and overdue patterns
- Tasks that appear to be waiting or blocked
- Unclear next actions
- Projects missing review schedules
- Time estimation patterns

## Basic Usage

```javascript
// Analyze all patterns
await mcp.analyze_patterns({
  patterns: ['all']
});

// Analyze specific patterns
await mcp.analyze_patterns({
  patterns: ['duplicates', 'dormant_projects', 'tag_audit']
});
```

## Pattern Types

### 1. Duplicate Detection (`duplicates`)
Finds tasks with similar names that might be duplicates.

**Example Request:**
```javascript
await mcp.analyze_patterns({
  patterns: ['duplicates'],
  options: {
    duplicate_similarity_threshold: '0.85', // 85% similarity
    max_tasks: '500'
  }
});
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "findings": {
    "duplicates": {
      "type": "duplicates",
      "severity": "warning",
      "count": 3,
      "items": [
        {
          "cluster_size": 2,
          "tasks": [
            {"id": "abc123", "name": "Review quarterly report", "project": "Q4 Planning"},
            {"id": "def456", "name": "Review quarterly reports", "project": "Admin"}
          ]
        }
      ],
      "recommendation": "Found 3 potential duplicate task clusters. Review and merge or clarify distinctions."
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Dormant Projects (`dormant_projects`)
Identifies projects that haven't been modified recently.

**Example Request:**
```javascript
await mcp.analyze_patterns({
  patterns: ['dormant_projects'],
  options: {
    dormant_threshold_days: '60' // Projects inactive for 60+ days
  }
});
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "findings": {
    "dormant_projects": {
      "type": "dormant_projects",
      "severity": "warning",
      "count": 5,
      "items": [
        {

    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Tag Audit (`tag_audit`)
Analyzes tag usage patterns, finds underused tags, and identifies potential synonyms.

**Example Request:**
```javascript
await mcp.analyze_patterns({
  patterns: ['tag_audit']
});
```

        "entropy_interpretation": "Moderate diversity"
      },
      "recommendation": "7 tags are rarely used. Consider removing or merging them. Found 2 potential tag synonyms that could be merged."
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Deadline Health (`deadline_health`)
Analyzes overdue tasks and deadline clustering.

**Example Request:**
```javascript
await mcp.analyze_patterns({
  patterns: ['deadline_health']

## Complete Examples

### Weekly Review Helper
```javascript
// Get a comprehensive weekly review analysis
const weeklyReview = await mcp.analyze_patterns({
  patterns: ['dormant_projects', 'review_gaps', 'deadline_health', 'waiting_for'],
  options: {
    dormant_threshold_days: '30',
    include_completed: 'false'
  }
});

// The response will include:

const cleanup = await mcp.analyze_patterns({
  patterns: ['duplicates', 'tag_audit', 'next_actions'],
  options: {
    duplicate_similarity_threshold: '0.8',
    max_tasks: '1000'
  }

```

### Project Health Check
```javascript
// Analyze overall system health
const healthCheck = await mcp.analyze_patterns({
  patterns: ['all'],
  options: {
    dormant_threshold_days: '45',
    include_completed: 'false',
    max_tasks: '5000'
  }
});

// Returns comprehensive analysis with health score
// and prioritized recommendations
```

## Understanding the Response

Each pattern analysis returns:

1. **Summary**: Overall health score and key insights
2. **Findings**: Detailed results for each pattern analyzed
3. **Metadata**: Performance metrics and analysis scope

### Severity Levels
- **`info`**: Normal findings, no action required
- **`warning`**: Issues that should be addressed
- **`critical`**: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention

### Health Score
The overall health score (0-100) is calculated based on:
- Number and severity of issues found
- Ratio of problematic items to total items
- Specific pattern thresholds

**Score Interpretation:**
- 80-100: Good - System is well-maintained
- 60-79: Fair - Some attention needed
- Below 60: Needs Attention - Multiple issues requiring action

## Performance Considerations

- The tool uses a "slimmed" data format to minimize memory usage
- Large databases (3000+ tasks) may take 5-10 seconds to analyze
- Results are not cached by default as patterns change frequently
- Set `max_tasks` to limit scope for faster analysis

## Use Cases

### 1. Weekly GTD Review
Run pattern analysis during your weekly review to identify:
- Projects needing review
- Stale or dormant projects
- Overdue and upcoming deadlines
- Waiting/blocked items to follow up

### 2. Quarterly Cleanup
Use for periodic maintenance:
- Merge duplicate tasks
- Consolidate similar tags
- Archive dormant projects
- Clarify vague next actions

### 3. System Optimization
Improve your GTD implementation:
- Identify workflow bottlenecks
- Find deadline clustering
- Analyze tag effectiveness
- Improve task clarity

### 4. Onboarding Analysis
When taking over or auditing a system:
- Get quick overview of system health
- Identify immediate issues
- Find cleanup opportunities
- Understand usage patterns

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start Broad, Then Focus**: Run `patterns: ['all']` first to get an overview, then drill into specific patterns.

2. **Adjust Thresholds**: Tune `dormant_threshold_days` and `duplicate_similarity_threshold` based on your workflow.

3. **Regular Reviews**: Run pattern analysis weekly or monthly as part of your review process.

4. **Act on Findings**: The tool identifies issues but doesn't fix them automatically. Use other MCP tools to:
   - Update tasks (`update_task`)
   - Complete projects (`projects` with operation: 'complete')
   - Manage tags (`tags` with operation: 'manage')

5. **Monitor Trends**: Save results over time to track improvement in your system's health score.

## Limitations

- Duplicate detection uses text similarity only (doesn't consider context)
- Waiting task detection relies on naming patterns
- Cannot measure actual time spent vs. estimates
- Pattern detection may have false positives
- Analysis is read-only (doesn't modify data)

## Integration with Other Tools

Combine with other MCP tools for a complete workflow:

```javascript
// 1. Analyze patterns
const analysis = await mcp.analyze_patterns({
  patterns: ['duplicates', 'dormant_projects']
});

// 2. Complete a dormant project
if (analysis.findings.dormant_projects.count > 0) {
  const dormantProject = analysis.findings.dormant_projects.items[0];
  await mcp.projects({
    operation: 'complete',
    projectId: dormantProject.id
  });
}

// 3. Merge duplicate tags
if (analysis.findings.tag_audit.items.potential_synonyms.length > 0) {
  const synonyms = analysis.findings.tag_audit.items.potential_synonyms[0];
  await mcp.tags({
    operation: 'manage',
    action: 'merge',
    tagName: synonyms.tag2,
    targetTag: synonyms.tag1
  });
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Tool times out on large databases:**
- Reduce `max_tasks` option
- Analyze fewer patterns at once
- Run during off-peak hours

**Too many false positive duplicates:**
- Increase `duplicate_similarity_threshold` to 0.9 or higher
- Review naming conventions for consistency

**Not finding expected patterns:**
- Check `include_completed` setting
- Verify `max_tasks` isn't too restrictive
- Ensure OmniFocus has a document open

**Unexpected results:**
- Pattern detection uses heuristics that may not match your workflow
- Adjust thresholds and options to fit your needs
- Some patterns may be intentional (e.g., similar task names in templates)
