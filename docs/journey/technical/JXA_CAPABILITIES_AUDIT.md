# JXA Capabilities Audit Results

## Summary
After thorough testing, we discovered that JXA has MORE capabilities than originally assumed. Many operations we thought required URL schemes actually work fine in JXA.

## Tested Operations

### ✅ Task Completion
- **Method**: `task.markComplete()` or `task.markComplete({date: completionDate})`
- **Status**: WORKS in JXA
- **Previous assumption**: Required URL scheme
- **Reality**: Works perfectly, we were just using wrong syntax (`task.completed = true` fails)

### ✅ Task Deletion  
- **Method**: `app.delete(task)`
- **Status**: WORKS in JXA
- **Previous assumption**: Required URL scheme
- **Reality**: Works without issues

### ✅ Project Assignment
- **Method**: `task.assignedContainer = project` or `task.assignedContainer = null` (for inbox)
- **Status**: WORKS in JXA
- **Previous assumption**: Sometimes required URL scheme
- **Reality**: Works, already implemented correctly in update-task.ts

### ✅ Tag Assignment
- **Method**: `task.addTag(tag)` 
- **Status**: Needs investigation - got "Can't convert types" error
- **Note**: Currently handled in update-task.ts with workarounds

## Recommendations

1. **Keep URL Scheme Fallbacks**: But only for genuine permission errors, not as primary method
2. **Update Error Messages**: Be more specific about why we're falling back to URL schemes
3. **Performance**: JXA is much faster than URL schemes, so fixing this improves performance
4. **User Experience**: Fewer permission prompts = better UX

## Current URL Scheme Fallbacks

1. **CompleteTaskTool.ts**: Falls back when JXA gets "access not allowed" - KEEP but should be rare
2. **DeleteTaskTool.ts**: Falls back when JXA gets "access not allowed" - KEEP but should be rare  
3. **DeleteProjectTool.ts**: Falls back for permission errors - KEEP but should be rare

## Conclusion

The URL scheme fallbacks are actually well-designed - they only trigger on real permission errors, not because of JXA limitations. The main fix needed was using the correct JXA methods (like `markComplete()` instead of setting properties).
