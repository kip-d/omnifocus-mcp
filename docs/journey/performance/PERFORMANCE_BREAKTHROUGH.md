# Performance Breakthrough Discovery

## The Real Culprit: JXA whose() Method

After extensive testing, we've discovered the REAL performance bottleneck:

### Performance Comparison (2,398 tasks database)

| Method | Time | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **JXA whose({completed: false})** | **25,000ms** | ❌ TERRIBLE! |
| JXA get all + manual filter | 3,400ms | ✅ 7x faster! |
| JXA get all (no filter) | 127ms | Lightning fast |
| Omni Automation filter all | 5,900ms | Consistent |
| Omni Automation count all | 5,800ms | Same as filter |

## The Shocking Truth

1. **JXA's whose() is catastrophically slow**: 25 seconds to filter by completion status!
2. **Manual filtering in JXA is FASTER**: Getting all tasks and filtering manually is 7x faster
3. **Omni Automation is consistent**: ~6 seconds whether filtering or not
4. **Getting all tasks in JXA is instant**: 127ms to get 2,398 tasks

## Why Our Performance Was Bad

### v1.12.0 and earlier (using whose())
```javascript
// This takes 25+ seconds!
const incompleteTasks = doc.flattenedTasks.whose({completed: false})();
```

### v1.13.0-1.13.1 (broken hybrid)
- Used non-existent where() method
- Fell back to iterating all tasks
- Added overhead of bridge

### The Solution: Manual Filtering

```javascript
// This takes only 3.4 seconds!
const allTasks = doc.flattenedTasks();
const incompleteTasks = [];
for (let i = 0; i < allTasks.length; i++) {
  if (!allTasks[i].completed()) {
    incompleteTasks.push(allTasks[i]);
  }
}
```

## Optimal Strategy for Each Query Type

### 1. Basic List (completed/flagged filter)
**Best: JXA manual filter** (3-4 seconds)
```javascript
const allTasks = doc.flattenedTasks();
for (const task of allTasks) {
  if (!task.completed() && task.flagged()) {
    // process task
  }
}
```

### 2. Date Range Queries (upcoming/overdue)
**Best: Either JXA manual or Omni** (both ~6 seconds)
- JXA: Can do everything in one pass
- Omni: Cleaner code, gets tags easily

### 3. Search
**Best: Omni Automation tasksMatching()** (likely optimized)
```javascript
const matches = tasksMatching("search term");
```

### 4. Tag Queries
**Best: Hybrid** - JXA for filtering, Omni for tag data
- JXA can't reliably get tags
- But can filter by other criteria first

## New Architecture Recommendation

### Phase 1: Replace all whose() with manual filtering
- Immediate 7x performance improvement
- No complex hybrid needed
- Works with existing code structure

### Phase 2: Selective Omni Automation
- Use tasksMatching() for search
- Use evaluateJavascript() only for tags
- Keep bulk operations in JXA

### Phase 3: Smart Caching
- Cache task lists for 30 seconds
- Invalidate on write operations
- Most queries hit cache

## Performance Projections

With manual filtering instead of whose():

| Query | Current (whose) | Projected (manual) | Improvement |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| List 50 tasks | 25s | 3-4s | 85% faster |
| Upcoming 7 days | 27s | 6s | 78% faster |
| Overdue tasks | 25s | 4s | 84% faster |
| Search | 25s + search | 6s | 76% faster |

## The Lesson

**JXA's whose() method is broken for performance**. It's not the bridge, it's not Omni Automation, it's not the hybrid approach - it's the whose() method that's been killing our performance all along!

The fix is simple: Don't use whose(). Get all tasks and filter manually. It's counterintuitive but 7x faster!
