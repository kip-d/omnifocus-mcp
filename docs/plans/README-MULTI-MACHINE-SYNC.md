# Multi-Machine Session Sync - Implementation Status

## Overview

The multi-machine session sync project has been **moved to a separate repository** to keep it independent from the OmniFocus MCP server work.

## Separate Repository

**Location:** `/Users/kip/src/multi-machine-claude-resume`

This is a general-purpose tool for managing work across multiple machines and should not be mixed with OmniFocus MCP-specific code.

## Documentation

- **README**: Full documentation with features, requirements, workflow
- **QUICK_START.md**: 5-minute setup guide
- **setup.sh**: Automated installation script

## What It Does

Provides shell functions for capturing and restoring session state across machines:

- `save-session` - Capture git branch, commit, current task, test results
- `restore-session` - View last checkpoint and instructions to continue
- `session-log` - View session history across all machines
- `session-status` - Check current machine and checkpoint status

Syncs via iCloud Drive for automatic cross-machine synchronization.

## Integration with Claude Code

- **Complements** `claude --resume` (which restores conversation history)
- **Captures** project state (git, task, tests, todos)
- **Together** provide complete context for multi-machine work

## Original Planning Document

See `/Users/kip/src/omnifocus-mcp/docs/plans/2025-10-18-multi-machine-session-sync.md` for the original design exploration and requirements gathering.

This design document is kept here for historical context and shows the design thinking that led to the separate repository approach.

## Next Steps

1. Clone/set up the separate repo: `~/src/multi-machine-claude-resume`
2. Follow QUICK_START.md for primary machine setup
3. Repeat on secondary machines
4. Test sync workflow

See `/Users/kip/src/multi-machine-claude-resume` for complete instructions.
