| Tags (names only) | **1.9s** | Ultra-fast mode |
| Tags (fast mode) | **3.7s** | Basic info + counts |
| Tags (with usage stats) | **~0.3s** | ✅ **Fully optimized OmniJS bridge** (319ms, was 12.7s hybrid, 72s pure JXA) |
| Productivity stats (week) | **2.8s** | ✅ **OmniJS bridge optimized** (was 94.6s with JXA) |
| Task velocity (7 days) | **53.2s** | ✅ **All tasks analyzed** (was 17.8s with 500-task limit) |

#### Task Queries - Warm Cache (BENCHMARK_MODE=warm) - ✅ NOW WORKING!
| Operation | Measured Time | vs Cold Cache | Cache Effectiveness |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Today's tasks (limit 25) | **3ms** | 41.9s | ✅ **13,964x faster** |
| Overdue tasks (limit 25) | **1ms** | 59.5s | ✅ **59,500x faster** |
| Upcoming tasks (7 days, limit 25) | **1ms** | 183.1s | ✅ **183,100x faster** |
| Project statistics | **6.8s** | 11.5s | 1.7x faster |
| Tags (names only) | **1.7s** | 1.8s | ~same |
| Tags (fast mode) | **3.2s** | 3.2s | ~same |
| Tags (with usage stats) | **~0.4s** | 0.3s | ✅ **Fully optimized OmniJS bridge** (39.8x faster than hybrid, 225x faster than pure JXA) |
| Productivity stats | **4.7s** | 2.8s | ✅ **OmniJS bridge optimized** (20x faster than old 94.6s) |
| Task velocity | **53.1s** | 53.2s | ~same (now analyzes all tasks) |

**Cache Warming Time:** ~52.6 seconds (measured October 6, 2025)

**Evolution:**
- **Pure JXA:** 184s (original implementation)
- **Hybrid OmniJS bridge:** 54s (partial optimization)
- **With tags optimization:** Expected ~2-3s based on component speeds
- **Measured:** 52.6s ⚠️ (investigation needed - tags now 0.3s but overall slow)

**⚠️ Cache Warming Investigation:** Despite tags optimization to 0.3s and analytics to 2.8s, cache warming measures 52.6s. Components individually are fast, but something in cache warming flow is slow. Requires investigation.

**✅ COMPONENT OPTIMIZATIONS WORK!** Tags (72s → 0.3s, 239x faster), Productivity stats (94.6s → 2.8s, 33.6x faster), and cache warming provides extraordinary performance gains for task queries (13,964-183,100x speedup).

**Performance Analysis - "Upcoming Tasks" Query:**
The 221-second duration for upcoming tasks is **expected behavior** given database characteristics:
- **Database size:** 1,879 tasks
- **Tasks with due dates:** 260 (13.8%)
- **Tasks due in next 7 days:** **Only 5 tasks**

**Why so slow?** The query must scan all 1,879 tasks looking for matches. With only 5 matches found, it scans the entire database before completing. This is fundamentally different from:
- **Today's tasks:** Checks due ≤3 days OR flagged (many more matches, stops scanning early)
- **Overdue tasks:** Checks due < today (finds matches earlier, stops scanning sooner)

**Key Finding:** Query performance is highly sensitive to data distribution:
- **Sparse matches** (few upcoming tasks) = Must scan entire database = Slow
- **Dense matches** (many flagged/overdue) = Stops early at limit = Faster
- This is expected behavior, not a bug or architectural issue

**Recommendations:**
1. Accept 3-4 minute query times for sparse data distributions
2. Use smaller `daysAhead` values (3 days instead of 7) to reduce search window
3. Regular database maintenance to archive/complete old tasks
4. Cache warming partially mitigates this (subsequent queries are faster)

## Key Findings

### 1. M2 Ultra Delivers 7-23x Speedup with OmniJS Bridge ✅
**Critical Discovery (Updated 2025-10-06):** M2 Ultra (192GB, 24 cores) dramatically outperforms M2 MacBook Air (24GB, 8 cores):
- **Cold cache task queries:** 7-13x faster (5.9-17.4s vs 41.8-220.9s)
- **Warm cache task queries:** 1-5ms (extraordinarily fast)
- **Tag operations (full mode):** 22.9x faster (3.7s vs 84.7s) with OmniJS bridge
- **Analytics:** 10-16x faster (6.0-6.8s vs 94.6s)
- **Far exceeds expected 2-3x improvement** documented in original predictions

**Largest Performance Gain:** Tag operations with OmniJS bridge optimizations (22.9x faster).

### 2. Cache Warming is Extraordinarily Effective
**Critical Discovery:** Cache warming provides **1,180-17,400x speedup** for task queries on M2 Ultra:
- Today's tasks: 5.9s → 5ms (1,180x faster)
- Overdue tasks: 6.4s → 2ms (3,220x faster)
- Upcoming tasks: 17.4s → 1ms (17,400x faster)

Cache warming is **mission-critical** for production use. Without it, even M2 Ultra takes 5.9-17.4s for first queries. Cache warming completes in ~10 seconds on M2 Ultra (20% faster than M2 Air's 12s).

### 3. M2 Air Cache Warming Fixed! ✅
**Issue Resolved:** Cache warming now works perfectly on M2 MacBook Air!

**Root Causes Identified and Fixed:**
1. **Cache key mismatch** - Cache warming used different parameters than actual queries:
   - Warming used `completed: false`, queries used `undefined` → different cache keys
   - Warming used `days` instead of `daysAhead` parameter
   - Warming used `details: false` (boolean), but needed exact parameter match

2. **TTL too short** - Task cache expired (30s) before cache warming completed (184s):
   - Cache entries evicted before queries ran
   - Increased TTL from 30s to 300s (5 minutes)

**Performance After Fix:**
- Today's tasks: 41.8s → 2ms (20,900x faster)
- Overdue tasks: 59.5s → 1ms (59,500x faster)
- Upcoming tasks: 220.9s → 0ms (instant)

**Impact:** M2 Air now gets identical cache warming benefits as M2 Ultra!

### 4. M2 Ultra Delivers Consistent 7-23x Speedup (Updated)
**Critical Insight:** M2 Ultra outperforms M2 Air across ALL operations (with actual measurements):
- ✅ **Task queries:** 7-13x faster (5.9-17.4s vs 41.8-220.9s)

- ✅ **Analytics:** 10.5-15.8x faster (661ms-6.8s vs 11.5-94.6s)

**M2 Ultra Performance Summary (Updated 2025-10-06):**
- Cold cache task queries: 5.9-17.4s (vs M2 Air: 41.8-220.9s)
- Warm cache task queries: 1-5ms (vs M2 Air: 0-2ms ✅ **cache fixed!**)
- Tags/analytics: 247ms-6.8s (vs M2 Air: 1.9-94.6s, tags now ~12s with OmniJS bridge)
- Cache warming: 10s (vs M2 Air: 12s) = 20% faster

**Conclusion:** Both M2 Ultra and M2 Air deliver exceptional warm-cache performance for task queries (0-5ms). M2 Ultra is 7-23x faster for cold-cache operations across all operation types, with the largest gains from OmniJS bridge optimizations for tag operations (22.9x).

## Performance Optimizations

### OmniJS Bridge for Cache Warming (v2.2.0+)

**Problem:** Original JXA-based unified cache warming timed out after 5+ minutes due to slow property access.

**Solution:** Use OmniJS `evaluateJavascript()` bridge for bulk property access.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// JXA wrapper calls OmniJS bridge
const omniJsScript = `
  flattenedTasks.forEach(task => {
    // OmniJS property access is much faster
    const taskId = task.id.primaryKey;
    const taskName = task.name;
    // ... process and filter tasks
  });
`;
const resultJson = app.evaluateJavascript(omniJsScript);
```

**Results:**
- **JXA-only approach:** Timed out after 5+ minutes (property access overhead)
- **OmniJS bridge approach:** 2.4 seconds for processing 1,510 tasks
- **Total cache warming (with task optimization only):** 54 seconds (includes projects, tags with JXA, perspectives)
- **Speedup (task optimization only):** 70% faster than previous 184s JXA-based approach
- **Total cache warming (with task + tags optimization):** ~12 seconds (tags also uses OmniJS bridge)
- **Final speedup:** 93% faster than original 184s (184s → 54s → 12s)

**Why OmniJS is faster:**
- Direct property access without JXA overhead
- Native JavaScript array operations
- Global `flattenedTasks` collection optimized by OmniFocus
- Single bridge call instead of 3 separate osascript processes

**Files:**
- `src/omnifocus/scripts/cache/warm-task-caches.ts` - Unified warming script
- `src/cache/CacheWarmer.ts` - Uses unified script for today/overdue/upcoming

### OmniJS Bridge for Tag Usage Stats (v2.2.0+)

**Problem:** Tags query with usage statistics (`includeUsageStats: true`) took ~72 seconds due to JXA property access overhead when iterating through ~5,000 tasks.

**Solution:** Use OmniJS `evaluateJavascript()` bridge for fast bulk task property access when counting tag usage.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// JXA wrapper calls OmniJS bridge for tag usage counting
const omniJsScript = `
  (() => {
    const tagUsageByName = {};

    // OmniJS: Use global flattenedTasks collection
    flattenedTasks.forEach(task => {
      const taskTags = task.tags || [];
      const isCompleted = task.completed || false;

      taskTags.forEach(tag => {
        const tagName = tag.name;
        if (!tagUsageByName[tagName]) {
          tagUsageByName[tagName] = { total: 0, active: 0, completed: 0 };
        }
        tagUsageByName[tagName].total++;
        if (isCompleted) {
          tagUsageByName[tagName].completed++;
        } else {
          tagUsageByName[tagName].active++;
        }
      });
    });

    return JSON.stringify(tagUsageByName);
  })()
`;
const resultJson = app.evaluateJavascript(omniJsScript);
```

**Results:**
- **JXA-only approach:** ~72 seconds for processing all tasks
- **OmniJS bridge approach:** ~12.7 seconds for processing 1,510 tasks
- **Speedup:** 82% faster (5.7x speedup)

**Why OmniJS is faster:**
- Direct property access (`task.tags`, `task.completed`) without JXA overhead
- Native JavaScript forEach operations on flattenedTasks collection
- Single bridge call instead of thousands of individual JXA property accesses
- Eliminates the 1-2ms overhead per task that JXA property access incurs

**Files:**
- `src/omnifocus/scripts/tags/list-tags.ts` - Tags listing with OmniJS bridge for usage stats (lines 99-148)

**Note:** Tags query without usage stats (`includeUsageStats: false`) remains fast at ~2-4 seconds using standard JXA, so the bridge is only used when usage statistics are requested.

### OmniJS Bridge for Analytics Operations (v2.3.0+)

Following the success of cache warming and tag optimizations, we applied the OmniJS bridge pattern to analytics operations.

#### Productivity Stats Optimization

**Problem:** Task iteration for productivity stats took ~1431ms due to JXA property access overhead on ~2400 tasks.

**Solution:** Use OmniJS bridge for bulk task counting and statistics.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const omniJsScript = `
  (() => {
    let totalTasks = 0;
    let totalCompleted = 0;
    let totalAvailable = 0;
    let completedInPeriod = 0;

    flattenedTasks.forEach(task => {
      totalTasks++;
      const isCompleted = task.completed || false;

      if (isCompleted) {
        totalCompleted++;
        // Check if completed in period
        const completionDate = task.completionDate;
        if (completionDate && completionDate.getTime() >= periodStartTime) {
          completedInPeriod++;
        }
      } else {
        // Check if available
        const blocked = task.taskStatus === Task.Status.Blocked;
        const deferDate = task.deferDate;
        const isDeferred = deferDate && deferDate.getTime() > nowTime;

        if (!blocked && !isDeferred) {
          totalAvailable++;
        }
      }
    });

    return JSON.stringify({ totalTasks, totalCompleted, totalAvailable, completedInPeriod });
  })()
`;
```

**Results (M4 Pro Mac Mini):**
- **Before (JXA):** 1431ms average
- **After (OmniJS bridge):** 261-1341ms (6-82% faster depending on configuration)
- **Speedup:** 1.1-5.5x faster
- **File:** `src/omnifocus/scripts/analytics/productivity-stats.ts:137-239`

#### Tags Full Optimization - Single OmniJS Bridge (October 6, 2025)

**Problem:** Original hybrid approach still had JXA pre-processing and post-processing overhead, taking 12.7s on M2 Air despite OmniJS bridge for usage stats.

**Solution:** Fully-optimized OmniJS bridge retrieves ALL data in a single call: tag properties + usage stats + parent hierarchy. Eliminates ALL JXA post-processing.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const omniJsScript = `
  (() => {
    const tagDataMap = {};
    const tagUsageByName = {};

    // Get all tag data with properties (replaces JXA loops)
    flattenedTags.forEach(tag => {
      tagDataMap[tag.name] = {
        id: tag.id.primaryKey,
        name: tag.name,
        parentId: tag.parent ? tag.parent.id.primaryKey : null,
        parentName: tag.parent ? tag.parent.name : null
      };
      tagUsageByName[tag.name] = { total: 0, active: 0, completed: 0 };
    });

    // Count usage if requested
    if (includeUsageStats) {
      flattenedTasks.forEach(task => {
        task.tags.forEach(tag => {
          tagUsageByName[tag.name].total++;
          // ... count active/completed
        });
      });
    }

    // Build array with all data
    const tagsArray = [];
    for (const tagName in tagDataMap) {
      tagsArray.push({
        id: tagDataMap[tagName].id,
        name: tagDataMap[tagName].name,
        usage: tagUsageByName[tagName],
        parentId: tagDataMap[tagName].parentId,
        parentName: tagDataMap[tagName].parentName
      });
    }

    return JSON.stringify(tagsArray);
  })()
`;
```

**Results (M2 MacBook Air):**
- **Before (hybrid OmniJS bridge):** 12.7s (separate bridges for properties and usage)
- **After (fully-optimized single bridge):** 0.3s (319ms measured October 6, 2025)
- **Speedup:** **39.8x faster** (97.5% improvement)
- **vs Pure JXA:** **225x faster** (72s → 0.3s)
- **File:** `src/omnifocus/scripts/tags/list-tags.ts:85-177`

**Key Improvement:** Single bridge call eliminated 5-7 seconds of JXA post-processing that was still present in hybrid approach. Combined with analytics optimizations, represents the most dramatic performance transformation in the entire project.

#### Task Velocity Optimization - Accuracy over Speed

**Problem:** Task velocity was artificially limited to 500 tasks to prevent timeouts, reducing accuracy.

**Approach Tested:** OmniJS bridge for all tasks
- **Result:** 3.3x slower (1228ms vs 344ms) due to serialization overhead
- **Conclusion:** Bridge overhead too high for this operation

**Solution Implemented:** Remove artificial limit, use JXA for all tasks

**Results (M4 Pro Mac Mini):**
- **Before:** 344ms (500 tasks only - limited accuracy)
- **After:** 326-1036ms (ALL ~2400 tasks - full accuracy)
- **Trade-off:** Slightly slower but **5x more data** for accurate velocity metrics
- **Benefit:** Complete dataset analysis instead of partial sample
- **File:** `src/omnifocus/scripts/analytics/task-velocity.ts:52-116`

#### Key Learnings from Analytics Optimizations

1. **OmniJS bridge is excellent for:**
   - Bulk property access on large collections
   - Operations where JXA property access is the bottleneck
   - Scenarios with minimal serialization overhead

2. **OmniJS bridge has too much overhead for:**
   - Operations with large result sets that need serialization
   - Already-fast operations (< 500ms)
   - Cases where JXA is already efficient

3. **Best practice:** Benchmark before optimizing
   - Created `scripts/benchmark-analytics.ts` for detailed testing
   - Test both JXA and bridge approaches
   - Measure multiple iterations for statistical significance

4. **Graceful degradation:** All optimizations include JXA fallbacks if bridge fails
