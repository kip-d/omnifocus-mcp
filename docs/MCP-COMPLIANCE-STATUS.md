# MCP Compliance Status

Last Updated: 2025-08-13

## Overview
This document tracks our compliance with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification and implementation status of core features.

## Core MCP Capabilities

### ✅ Tools (Implemented)
**Status**: Fully implemented with 27+ tools
- Task operations (CRUD)
- Project management
- Analytics and insights
- Export functionality
- Tag management

### ✅ Prompts (Implemented and Supported)
**Status**: Fully supported in Claude Desktop v0.12.55+
- `gtd_weekly_review` - Weekly GTD review with stale project detection
- `gtd_process_inbox` - Inbox processing with GTD methodology
- **Note**: Claude Desktop v0.12.55+ supports MCP prompts

### ❌ Resources (Not Implemented)
**Status**: Planned in proposals
- Would provide direct data access
- Better performance for read operations
- See: `docs/proposals/mcp-resources-implementation.md`

## Technical Compliance

### ✅ Completed Improvements
1. **Zod Schema Migration** - Complete type-safe validation
2. **Error Handling** - Proper McpError usage throughout
3. **Response Format** - Standardized response structure
4. **Capability Declaration** - Properly declares tools and prompts

### ⚠️ Minor Gaps
1. **Consent Mechanisms** - Not implemented (see proposals)
2. **Resource Subscriptions** - N/A until resources implemented
3. **Progress Notifications** - Not possible with MCP architecture

## Performance Optimizations

### ✅ Implemented
- Smart caching with TTLs (1m tasks, 10m projects, 1h analytics)
- skipAnalysis parameter for faster queries
- Early termination in list operations
- Optimized whose() queries per JXA best practices

### ⚠️ Known Limitations
- Some operations still slow due to JXA constraints
- No streaming/progress for long operations (MCP limitation)
- Cache warming not implemented (documented as future enhancement)

## Next Steps

1. **High Priority**
   - Implement consent mechanisms for security

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Implement MCP Resources
   - Add subscription support for resources

3. **Low Priority**
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Additional analytics tools

## Summary

- **MCP Compliance**: ~85% (missing only Resources)
- **Best Practices**: >90% compliance
- **Main Gap**: Resources not implemented
- **Blocker**: None (Claude Desktop v0.12.55+ supports MCP prompts)
