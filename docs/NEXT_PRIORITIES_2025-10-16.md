# Next Priorities - Brainstorming Session (2025-10-16)

**Generated**: October 16, 2025, 6:00 PM
**Status**: Ready to execute - Choose your path!
**Foundation**: All Quick Win phases completed, bulk optimizations shipped today

## ðŸŽ‰ What We Just Achieved

**Today's Commits:**
- âœ… `4f36d2e` - perf: implement optimized bulk complete using single-pass pattern
- âœ… `7d48b49` - docs: add profiling analysis results identifying bulk_complete as next optimization

**Overall Completion Status (as of Oct 8 roadmap update):**
- âœ… 18 major features implemented across foundation, optimization, and high-value feature phases
- âœ… Bulk operations fully optimized (70-80% performance improvements)
- âœ… Advanced search with operators (CONTAINS, OR/AND, date ranges)
- âœ… Smart Capture from meeting notes with AI extraction
- âœ… Real LLM testing with Ollama (validated on M2 Air, M4 Pro, M2 Ultra)
- âœ… Database export, cache validation, granular cache invalidation
- âœ… Comprehensive error taxonomy with recovery guidance
- âœ… ~71 hours of implementation work completed

**The verdict from IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md line 5:**
> "ALL Quick Win Phases COMPLETED + Advanced Search + Smart Capture - Foundation solid, high-value features delivered"

## ðŸš€ Three Clear Paths Forward

### Option A: Workflow Automation Bundles (2-3 days)
**Best for**: Immediate user value, leveraging existing prompt infrastructure

**What it is**: Composite tools that combine multiple operations into single workflows
- Example: `plan_my_day()` â†’ internally calls `tasks(mode: today)` + `productivity_stats()` + `analyze_overdue()`
- Example: `weekly_review()` â†’ orchestrates multiple review operations

**Why now**:
- Prompts already exist (see `src/prompts/gtd/`)
- Tool layer is straightforward (glue existing tools together)
- High user impact (Claude users love single-step workflows)
- Natural progression from individual tools

**Roadmap reference**: Line 486, "Workflow Automation" listed as major feature
**Implementation time**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: None (all tools exist)

---

### Option B: Mac mini CI Deployment (1-2 days, mostly operational)
**Best for**: System health, catching OmniFocus-specific issues early

**What it is**: Self-hosted GitHub runner on Mac hardware to run full integration tests
- Currently: Linux CI only (can't run OmniFocus operations)
- Problem: Cache warming, real permission checks, actual OmniFocus interactions not tested
- Solution: Deploy documented Mac runner to get full CI coverage

**Why now**:
- Documentation complete (see `docs/SELF_HOSTED_CI_MAC.md`)
- Integration tests broken by cache warming initially (commit 532efbc fixed it)
- Catch regressions before they hit production
- Validates real workflows vs simulations

**Roadmap reference**: Line 1070-1094, fully documented as optional enhancement
**Implementation time**: 1-2 days (mostly operational setup)
**Dependencies**: Mac mini hardware, OmniFocus license, test database

---

### Option C: Data-Driven Auto-Recovery (1-2 hours analysis, 6-8 hours if implementing)
**Best for**: Solving transient failure problems if they exist

**What it is**: Intelligent retry with exponential backoff for recoverable failures
- Only implement if error metrics warrant it (>10% of failures are recoverable)
- Logging infrastructure already exists to measure this

**Why now**:
- Error taxonomy complete (categorizes recoverable vs permanent)
- Correlation ID system enables request tracing
- Need empirical data to decide if worth building
- Analysis step is trivial (1-2 hours to review error logs)

**Roadmap reference**: Line 176-196, deferred pending error metrics analysis
**Implementation time**: 1-2 hours to analyze, then conditional 6-8 hours to implement
**Dependencies**: Access to error metrics from production usage

## ðŸŽ¯ Decision Matrix

| Factor | Workflow Bundles | Mac CI | Auto-Recovery |
|--------|------------------|--------|----------------|
| **Time Investment** | 2-3 days | 1-2 days | 1-2h + conditional |
| **User Impact** | High (immediate) | Medium (quality) | High (reliability) |
| **Complexity** | Low (glue) | Medium (ops) | Medium (logic) |
| **Dependencies** | None | Hardware | Data collection |
| **Ready to Start** | Yes, now | Yes, now | Needs analysis first |
| **Risk Level** | Low | Low | Low |

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendation

**Start with: Workflow Automation Bundles**

Rationale:
1. **Highest ROI**: User-facing, immediate value, no blockers
2. **Natural progression**: All building blocks exist, just orchestration
3. **Momentum**: Fresh off bulk operation victories, energy high
4. **Parallel opportunity**: Could do Mac CI setup in parallel (mostly waiting)

### Next Session Blueprint

1. **First 30 min**: Read the Brainstorming skill (you have it)
2. **Next 1.5 hours**: Design the Workflow Bundles architecture
   - How many bundles? (estimate 3-5 high-value ones)
   - Data flow between tools?
   - LLM-friendly descriptions?
3. **Decision point**: Approve design or refine
4. **Then**: Choose between implementation, Mac CI setup, or auto-recovery analysis
