# Next Session Plan: OmniFocus MCP v2.1.0 Architecture Improvements

## üéØ Current Status (September 8, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Major Breakthroughs Completed
1. **Script Syntax Error Investigation** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
   - Root cause: Scripts referenced undefined helper functions (`prepareRepetitionRuleData`, `applyRepetitionRuleViaBridge`, `setTagsViaBridge`)
   - Fixed CREATE_TASK_SCRIPT and documented in LESSONS_LEARNED.md
   - No more "SyntaxError: Unexpected EOF (-2700)" errors

2. **CLI Testing Mystery** - SOLVED ‚úÖ
   - Discovered CLI testing was working correctly all along
   - Issue was missing `clientInfo` parameter in MCP initialization
   - Git bisect revealed problem existed from first commit (never was broken)
   - Documented proper MCP protocol requirements in LESSONS_LEARNED.md

3. **Comprehensive Tool Testing** - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
   - Built and tested all 15 MCP tools via CLI
   - **Success Rate: 13% (2/15 tools working properly)**
   - Identified specific patterns of failure for systematic debugging

### üìä Tool Status Summary (via CLI Testing)
```
‚úÖ Working Perfectly (2/15):
  - system: Version info works perfectly
  - folders: Folder operations work perfectly

‚ö†Ô∏è Silent Failures (11/15):
  - tasks, manage_task, projects, tags, productivity_stats, 
    task_velocity, analyze_overdue, analyze_patterns, export,
    recurring_tasks, perspectives
  - Execute without errors but return no response
  - Likely runtime issues in script execution or response handling

‚ùå Parameter Validation Errors (2/15):
  - manage_reviews: Missing required operation parameter
  - workflow_analysis: Type coercion issues (string‚Üíarray, string‚Üíboolean)
```

## üö® Next Priority: Silent Tool Failures

### The Problem
11 out of 15 tools execute successfully but return no response. This indicates:
- ‚úÖ MCP protocol working correctly
- ‚úÖ Tool initialization successful  
- ‚ùå Script execution likely failing silently during runtime
- ‚ùå Response not being returned to CLI

### Investigation Strategy for Next Session
1. **Focus on One Tool**: Start with `manage_task` (most critical)
2. **Add Detailed Logging**: Enhance error reporting in tool execution
3. **Script Runtime Analysis**: Check if scripts complete execution
4. **Response Pipeline**: Verify response formatting and transmission

### Potential Root Causes
- **Script Runtime Errors**: Scripts fail during execution (not syntax)
- **Response Formatting**: Issues with MCP response structure
- **OmniFocus Integration**: JXA/osascript execution problems
- **Cache/Timeout Issues**: Long-running operations timing out
- **Error Handling**: Silent failure in error handling paths

## üìã TODO for Next Session

### High Priority (Must Fix)
- [ ] **Debug manage_task silent failure**
  - Add comprehensive logging to CreateTaskTool
  - Test script execution directly with osascript
  - Verify response pipeline from script‚Üítool‚ÜíMCP
  
- [ ] **Fix parameter validation errors**
  - Update manage_reviews test to include required operation parameter
  - Fix workflow_analysis string‚Üítype coercion issues
  
- [ ] **Implement enhanced error reporting**
  - Add detailed execution logging throughout tool chain
  - Capture and report script execution errors with context
  - Improve error visibility for debugging

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Test script execution independently**
  - Run CREATE_TASK_SCRIPT directly via osascript outside MCP
  - Verify OmniFocus integration works independently
  - Isolate MCP vs OmniFocus vs script issues

- [ ] **Systematic tool debugging**
  - Once manage_task is fixed, apply same pattern to other 10 silent tools
  - Document common failure patterns and solutions
  - Create debugging playbook for future issues

### Low Priority
- [ ] **CLI testing improvements**
  - Enhance test-all-tools.cjs with better error reporting
  - Include response content analysis and validation
  - Add timeout handling and retry logic

## üîß Development Environment Notes

### Current Branch & Status
```bash
git branch: feature/v2.1.0-architecture-improvements
Latest commit: 9d30d18 - "fix: resolve script syntax errors causing tool failures"
Status: Script syntax issues RESOLVED ‚úÖ, Runtime issues NEED INVESTIGATION ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

### Key Files Modified This Session
- `src/omnifocus/scripts/tasks/create-task.ts` - Fixed undefined function references
- `src/tools/tasks/ManageTaskTool.ts` - Added CLI debugging mode
- `docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - Added comprehensive script syntax error documentation
- `test-all-tools.cjs` - Created comprehensive CLI testing script

### Essential Testing Commands
```bash
# Build first (always required)
npm run build

# Test specific tool (known working)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0.0"}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"system","arguments":{"operation":"version"}}}' | node dist/index.js

# Test failing tool (manage_task)  
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0.0"}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"manage_task","arguments":{"operation":"create","name":"Test Task"}}}' | MCP_CLI_TESTING=1 node dist/index.js

# Test all tools systematically
node test-all-tools.cjs
```

## üéØ Success Criteria for Next Session

### Minimum Acceptable Success
- [ ] Get `manage_task` tool returning responses via CLI (currently silent)
- [ ] Document root cause of the 11 silent failures
- [ ] Achieve at least 33% tool success rate (5/15 tools working)

### Target Success  
- [ ] Get 10/15 tools working (67% success rate) 
- [ ] Comprehensive debugging documentation added to LESSONS_LEARNED.md
- [ ] Established automated testing pipeline for continued development

### Stretch Goal
- [ ] All 15 tools working perfectly via CLI (100% success rate)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and optimization
- [ ] Ready for production v2.1.0 release

## üí° Critical Insights for Next Developer

1. **Script Syntax vs Runtime Issues**: We solved syntax errors ‚úÖ, but runtime failures are separate and more complex
2. **MCP Protocol Is Solid**: CLI testing infrastructure works perfectly - focus on tool-internal issues
3. **Progressive Debugging Works**: Start with simplest failing tool, establish patterns, then scale solutions
4. **Documentation Is Critical**: Every breakthrough must be documented in LESSONS_LEARNED.md to prevent regression

## üöÄ Architecture Context

This session is part of v2.1.0 architecture improvements including:
- ‚úÖ Template substitution elimination (preventing syntax errors)
- üîÑ Function arguments approach (safer parameter passing) 
- üîÑ Discriminated unions (better error handling)
- üîÑ Script size optimization (performance improvements)

**Current Status**: Foundation issues resolved, now focusing on runtime reliability.

## Pre-Merge Preparation (Lower Priority)

### Code Review (After Tool Fixes)
- Review TypeScript fixes for correctness and maintainability
- Validate architectural improvements and consolidation decisions
- Check for any missed optimization opportunities

### Release Preparation (After 67%+ Success Rate)
- Update README.md to reflect v2.1.0 changes and 15-tool architecture
- Update package.json version to 2.1.0
- Create comprehensive CHANGELOG.md entry
- Performance testing and benchmarking
- Documentation updates and verification
