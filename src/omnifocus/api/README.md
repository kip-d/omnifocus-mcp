# OmniFocus API TypeScript Definitions

This directory contains the official TypeScript definitions for OmniFocus automation.

## Current Version: OmniFocus.d.ts → OmniFocus-4.8.3-d.ts

- **Current**: `OmniFocus.d.ts` (symlink to latest version)
- **Latest Version**: OmniFocus 4.8.3
- **Previous Version**: OmniFocus 4.6.1 (archived in `versions/`)

## File Structure

- `OmniFocus.d.ts` - Symlink to the current version (always points to latest)
- `OmniFocus-4.8.3-d.ts` - Official TypeScript definitions for OmniFocus 4.8.3
- `OmniFocus-extensions.d.ts` - Undocumented but working properties (empirically verified)
- `versions/` - Archived previous versions (excluded from TypeScript compilation)
  - `OmniFocus-4.6.1-d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for OmniFocus 4.6.1

## Usage

These definitions provide type information for all OmniFocus automation objects and methods available through JavaScript for Automation (JXA).

### Key Classes:
- `Task` - Core task management
- `Project` - Project management
- `Tag` - Tag management
- `Document` - Document-level operations
- `Database` - Database operations
- `Perspective` - Perspective management

### Important Notes:
1. These are the official API definitions from OmniGroup
2. They represent the actual automation interface available in each OmniFocus version
3. Some methods in these definitions may behave differently in JXA context
4. Always test automation scripts in OmniFocus before relying on them
5. Version-specific features (like Anchor Dates in 4.8+) are only available in corresponding versions

## Undocumented API Extensions

The `OmniFocus-extensions.d.ts` file contains properties not included in the official API export but accessible via JXA.

**Verified on OmniFocus 4.8.3** (October 2025) - All 14 properties tested ✅

### Project Extensions (4 properties)
- `effectiveStatus: Project.Status` - Effective status considering parent folders
- `singletonActionHolder: boolean` - Whether project contains singleton actions
- `nextTask: Task | null` - Next actionable child task in this project
- `defaultSingletonActionHolder: boolean` - Whether this is the default singleton action holder

### Tag Extensions (2 properties)
- `availableTaskCount: number` - Number of available tasks with this tag or descendants
- `remainingTaskCount: number` - Number of incomplete tasks with this tag or descendants

### Task Extensions (8 properties)
- `numberOfTasks: number` - Total number of direct child tasks
- `numberOfAvailableTasks: number` - Number of available direct child tasks
- `numberOfCompletedTasks: number` - Number of completed direct child tasks
- `next: boolean` - Whether this is the next actionable task in its project
- `blocked: boolean` - Whether task has blocking dependencies
- `effectivelyCompleted: boolean` - Whether task or its container is completed
- `effectivelyDropped: boolean` - Whether task or its container is dropped

**Testing:** Run `node test-extensions.js` to verify these properties on your OmniFocus version.

## How to Regenerate API Definitions

When a new version of OmniFocus is released, follow these steps to update the TypeScript definitions:

### Step 1: Export from OmniFocus

1. Open **OmniFocus**
2. Go to **Automation** → **API Reference** in the menu bar
3. A window titled **"Scripting Interface"** will open
4. Click the **export icon** (square with upward arrow) in the toolbar
5. In the save dialog, select **TypeScript** from the format dropdown
   - Available formats: HTML Text, Markdown, TypeScript
6. Save the file as `OmniFocus.ts` to your Downloads folder

### Step 2: Version and Archive

1. Note the OmniFocus version number (e.g., 4.8.3) from **OmniFocus → About OmniFocus**
2. Move the exported file to this directory:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/OmniFocus.ts src/omnifocus/api/OmniFocus-[VERSION]-d.ts
   ```
   Replace `[VERSION]` with the version number (e.g., `4.8.3`)

3. Archive the previous current version:
   ```bash
   git mv src/omnifocus/api/OmniFocus.d.ts src/omnifocus/api/OmniFocus-[OLD_VERSION]-d.ts
   ```

4. Create a symlink to the new version:
   ```bash
   cd src/omnifocus/api
   ln -s OmniFocus-[VERSION]-d.ts OmniFocus.d.ts
   ```

### Step 3: Update Documentation

1. Update the version information at the top of this README
2. Check for new API features by comparing versions:
   ```bash
   diff OmniFocus-[OLD_VERSION]-d.ts OmniFocus-[NEW_VERSION]-d.ts
   ```
3. Document any new features or breaking changes
4. Update references in code that use version-specific features

### Step 4: Test and Verify

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Check that TypeScript compilation succeeds
4. Test any scripts that use new API features

### Step 5: Commit Changes

```bash
git add src/omnifocus/api/
git commit -m "feat: update OmniFocus API definitions to version [VERSION]"
```

## Integration with MCP Bridge

The MCP bridge uses these definitions as a reference for:
- Correct method signatures
- Available properties and methods
- Type safety in our TypeScript code
- Understanding OmniFocus object relationships
- Version-specific feature detection
