# Session Context - 2025-08-11

## Current Status
- **Version**: 1.11.1 (just released)
- **Last Commit**: fix: standardize perspective query response format (v1.11.1)
- **All Tests Passing**: 249 tests passing, 1 skipped

## Session Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Query Perspective Integration Issues (v1.11.1) âœ…
- **Response Format Standardization**: Changed from `data.items` to `data.tasks` for consistency
- **Added Structured Perspective Data**: Response now includes `data.perspective` object
- **Improved Error Handling**: Properly handles non-existent perspectives
- **Fixed Integration Test Timeouts**: Reduced from 30s to ~7s typical response time
- **Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript interfaces for perspective responses

### 2. Previous: Perspective Tools Implementation (v1.11.0) âœ…
- **list_perspectives**: Enumerate all perspectives (built-in and custom) with filter rules
- **query_perspective**: Get tasks matching perspective filters  
- Successfully discovered perspective access via `evaluateJavascript()` bridge
- Found 30 perspectives in testing (8 built-in, 22 custom)
- Enables LLM to see what users see in their perspectives
- Full collaborative task processing now possible

### 2. Eisenhower Matrix Prompt âœ…
- Added new GTD prompt for inbox processing
- Uses urgent/important quadrants for task categorization
- Integrated with MCP prompts system

### 3. Project Template Research âœ…
- Documented 6 comprehensive GTD project templates
- Client projects, product launches, event planning, home improvement, learning, travel
- Ready for future prompt implementation

### 4. Documentation Improvements âœ…
- Added recurrence examples to README
- Updated FEATURE_ROADMAP with v1.10.0 accomplishments
- Created PERSPECTIVE-ACCESS-DISCOVERY.md documenting the breakthrough
- Created JXA-CAPABILITIES-RESEARCH.md for future reference
- Created SWIFT-VS-JXA-ANALYSIS.md explaining why to stay with JXA

### 5. Claude Code Status Line Enhancement
- Fixed status line to show context percentage before auto-compact
- Script now properly calls `bun x ccusage statusline`
- Shows both external token tracking and internal context usage

## Key Technical Discoveries

### Perspective Access via evaluateJavascript()
```javascript
// We can enumerate all perspectives
Perspective.all // All perspectives
Perspective.Custom.all // Custom perspectives with filter rules
perspective.archivedFilterRules // The actual filter logic!
```

### Filter Rule Translation
- Successfully decoded perspective filter rules
- Can translate rules to query parameters
- Enables simulation of perspective views without UI access

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Technical Debt
1. **query_perspective integration tests** - Some timeout issues but core functionality works
2. **Complex perspective filters** - Some custom perspectives have rules we can't fully translate
3. **Perspective grouping/sorting** - Can't replicate exact display order

### Performance Considerations
- Perspective tools use 5-minute cache for list, 30-second for queries
- Filter translation adds minimal overhead
- Successfully handles 30+ perspectives

## Testing Results
- Unit tests: 249 passing âœ…
- Perspective enumeration: 30 perspectives found âœ…
- Tools registered and available âœ…
- Direct JXA scripts working âœ…

## Environment Details
- Node.js 18+
- OmniFocus 4.6+ on macOS
- TypeScript project
- MCP SDK 1.13.0
- Using evaluateJavascript() bridge extensively

## Quick Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Check current state
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Run tests
npm run build && npm test

# Test perspective tools
osascript -l JavaScript test-perspectives-simple.js

# Test MCP integration
node tests/integration/test-as-claude-desktop.js

# Check perspective access
npx tsx test-perspective-comprehensive.ts
```

## Files Modified This Session
- `/src/tools/perspectives/` - New perspective tools
- `/src/omnifocus/scripts/perspectives.ts` - Perspective scripts
- `/src/prompts/gtd/eisenhower-matrix.ts` - New prompt
- `/README.md` - Added recurrence examples
- `/CHANGELOG.md` - Version 1.11.0 notes
- `/docs/FEATURE_ROADMAP.md` - Updated accomplishments

## Important Context

### Vision Achieved
Your vision of an LLM assistant that can:
- See what users see in perspectives âœ…
- Work alongside them collaboratively âœ…  
- Help break down projects into actionable steps âœ…
- Not interfere with user's OmniFocus view âœ…

This is now fully realized with the perspective tools!

### Why We Stayed with JXA
After thorough analysis, we determined:
- Swift would use the SAME OmniFocus API (no additional access)
- 20,000+ lines of working code would need rewriting
- evaluateJavascript() bridge is MORE powerful than pure Swift
- 2-3 months effort for no real gain

## Git Remote
- Repository: github.com:kip-d/omnifocus-mcp.git
- Main branch: main
- Latest version: 1.11.0

## Dev Environment Notes (Not Part of MCP Server)

### Claude Code Status Line Configuration
- Fixed status line to show both ccusage output AND context percentage
- Used full path to bun executable (`/Users/kip/.bun/bin/bun`) to resolve PATH issues
- Status line now shows: `ðŸ¤– Opus 4.1 | ðŸ’° $X session / $Y today | Context: ~XX%`
- Configuration in `~/.claude/statusline-enhanced.sh`
