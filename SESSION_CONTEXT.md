# Session Context - 2025-08-20

## Current Status
- **Version**: 2.0.0 (READY FOR RELEASE)
- **Last Commit**: f89b1f7 - 100% test pass rate achieved!
- **Repository**: All fixes committed and pushed
- **Test Results**: 100% PASS RATE (9/9 tests passing)

## Session Accomplishments (Aug 20, 2025)

### ✅ SOLVED: Critical Issues (All Fixed)
1. **update_task script truncation** - FIXED
   - Root cause: Parameter expansion creating 50KB+ scripts
   - Solution: Ultra-minimal script (5KB) with JSON parameters
   - Result: All updates working perfectly

2. **Tag visibility issues** - FIXED
   - Root cause: Writing via bridge, reading via JXA
   - Solution: Complete bridge consistency
   - Result: Tags immediately visible

3. **Repeat rule updates** - FIXED
   - Root cause: sanitizeUpdates() filtering out parameters
   - Solution: Added repeatRule to sanitization whitelist
   - Result: All repeat operations working

### Performance Achieved
- ✅ All queries under 2 seconds
- ✅ Script size reduced by 90% (51KB → 5KB)
- ✅ No more script truncation issues
- ✅ Tag operations instantaneous

### Test Suite Results
```
✅ Create task with tags - PASS
✅ Update task tags - PASS
✅ Invalid project ID validation - PASS
✅ Move task to inbox - PASS
✅ Create task with repeat rule - PASS
✅ Update repeat rule to weekly - PASS
✅ Clear repeat rule - PASS
✅ Performance under 2s - PASS
✅ Complete task - PASS
```

### No Known Issues Remaining
- ~~Tag updates don't work~~ ✅ FIXED with bridge consistency
- ~~Repeat rule updates fail~~ ✅ FIXED with sanitization
- ~~Script truncation errors~~ ✅ FIXED with ultra-minimal approach

## Previous Fixes Applied (Aug 19)
- **Root Cause**: `whose()` method was catastrophically slow
- **Solution**: Implemented ultra-fast single-pass algorithm
- **Result**: 10x improvement (8-15s → 0.8s)
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `todays-agenda.ts` - Removed all whose() calls
  - `todays-agenda-optimized.ts` - Removed 3 whose() calls
  - `todays-agenda-ultra-fast.ts` - NEW optimized implementation
  - `QueryTasksToolV2.ts` - Updated to use ultra-fast script

### Bug Fixes Applied
- **update_task syntax errors**: Fixed missing quotes in evaluateJavascript (lines 211, 282)
- **complete_task null reference**: Added safe handling for recurring tasks
- **Date format guidance**: Improved tool descriptions to explicitly require YYYY-MM-DD format
