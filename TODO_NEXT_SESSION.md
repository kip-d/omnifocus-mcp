# TODO Next Session

## Current Version: 2.0.0-beta.4 (released)
**Status**: V1 tools preserved for backward compatibility, all major features complete!
**Ready for**: Production testing and v2.0.0 final release

## üéâ Major Achievements This Session
- **PRESERVED V1 TOOLS** in legacy-v1 directory (frozen/amber status)
- **FIXED INTEGRATION TEST** timeout issue with proper server cleanup
- **MAINTAINED BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY** via OMNIFOCUS_MCP_ENABLE_LEGACY_TOOLS
- **DOCUMENTED FREEZE STATUS** comprehensively in multiple locations
- **VERIFIED PERSPECTIVE QUERIES** working correctly (returning Inbox tasks)

## Performance Metrics

### Perspective Query Overhead
- **Initial query**: 3-5 seconds (filtering all tasks)
- **Cached queries**: <500ms (30-second TTL)
- **Overhead vs direct**: ~1-2 seconds for filter rule application
- **Memory impact**: Minimal, rules are lightweight
- **Acceptable for**: Natural language queries, custom perspectives

### Overall Bridge Performance
- **Tag assignment**: ~50-100ms overhead
- **Repeat rules**: ~50-100ms overhead  
- **Task reparenting**: ~50-100ms overhead
- **Perspective queries**: 1-2s overhead (due to filtering)

## Testing Checklist for Next Session

### Integration Test Improvements ‚úÖ COMPLETED!
- [x] Fixed MCP server test scripts to exit properly after tool calls
- [x] Updated test-perspective-v2.ts with McpTestRunner cleanup utility
- [x] Reviewed all integration tests for timeout issues
- [x] Added proper process.exit() to all test scripts
- [x] Created universal test cleanup utility at `tests/utils/test-cleanup.ts`

### V2.0.0 Final Release Testing
- [ ] Full integration test suite with production data
- [ ] Performance benchmarks with 5000+ tasks
- [ ] Stress test perspective queries
- [ ] Verify V1 tools remain functional when enabled (for rollback only)
- [ ] Test upgrade from v1.x (should be seamless - LLM just uses better tools)

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Complete API reference for V2 tools
- [ ] Performance tuning guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Update README to highlight v2.0.0 improvements (better LLM experience)

### Release Preparation
- [ ] Create comprehensive release notes for v2.0.0
- [ ] Update README with V2 improvements (focus on reliability & speed)
- [ ] Emphasize seamless upgrade - users just get better performance
- [ ] Plan announcement strategy (highlight: "It just works better now")

## Known Remaining Limitations

### Minor Issues (Won't Block Release)
1. **Complex filter rules**: Some advanced OmniFocus filters may not be fully supported
2. **Performance on large databases**: 10,000+ tasks may be slow
3. **Custom perspective detection**: Requires OmniFocus Pro

### Future Enhancements
1. **Streaming responses** for large perspective queries
2. **Progressive loading** for better UX
3. **Filter rule optimization** for complex queries
4. **Perspective change notifications**

## Production Readiness Assessment

### What's Ready ‚úÖ
- Core CRUD operations
- Tag management
- Repeat rules
- Task reparenting
- Perspective queries
- Project management
- Review workflows
- Export functionality

### What Needs Polish üîß
- Performance optimization for huge databases
- Advanced filter rule edge cases
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Diagnostic tooling

## Next Steps Priority

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Fix Integration Test Exit Handling**
   - Update test scripts to properly exit after MCP calls
   - Prevent timeout issues in CI/CD pipelines
   - Clean up test-perspective-*.ts files

2. **V2.0.0 Final Preparation**
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Document all V2 features
   - Create migration guide

3. **Production Testing**
   - Deploy beta.4 to early adopters
   - Gather feedback on all new features
   - Monitor performance and stability

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile perspective query bottlenecks
   - Optimize filter rule evaluation
   - Consider parallel processing

2. **Documentation**
   - User guide for perspective queries
   - Performance tuning guide
   - API reference updates

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **v2.0.0 Final Release**
   - Incorporate beta feedback
   - Final performance tuning
   - Complete documentation

2. **v2.1.0 Planning**
   - Streaming responses
   - Advanced filtering
   - Batch perspective queries

## Key Technical Insights

### Perspective Query Architecture
```javascript
// No window manipulation approach
const filterRules = perspective.archivedFilterRules;
const tasks = flattenedTasks.filter(task => 
  applyFilterRules(task, filterRules, aggregation)
);
// User's window remains untouched!
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy
1. **Cache aggressively**: 30-second TTL for perspectives
2. **Filter efficiently**: Early exit conditions
3. **Limit results**: Default to reasonable limits
4. **Defer details**: Load full details only when needed

## Questions Resolved This Session
1. ‚úÖ Can we query perspectives without changing windows? **YES**
2. ‚úÖ Can we move tasks between parents? **YES - moveTasks()**
3. ‚úÖ Is the bridge pattern sustainable? **YES - proven reliable**
4. ‚úÖ Are we ready for production? **YES - with beta testing**

## Confidence Level: 95%
- ‚úÖ All major features working
- ‚úÖ Performance acceptable
- ‚úÖ No GUI interference
- ‚úÖ Natural language friendly
- ‚úÖ Well-documented

## Critical Reminders
‚ö†Ô∏è **V1 tools are FROZEN** - never modify files in legacy-v1 directory
‚ö†Ô∏è **Test both V1 and V2** - ensure backward compatibility works
‚ö†Ô∏è **Never change window.perspective** - always filter programmatically
‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor performance** with large task databases
‚ö†Ô∏è **Document edge cases** as they're discovered

## V1 Tools Status
- **Location**: `src/tools/legacy-v1/`
- **Status**: FROZEN - preserved for backward compatibility
- **Activation**: `OMNIFOCUS_MCP_ENABLE_LEGACY_TOOLS=true`
- **Policy**: NO modifications allowed - use V2 tools for all new development
