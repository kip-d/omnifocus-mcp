# OmniFocus MCP v1.13.1 Hotfix Verification

## 🔥 Critical Performance Regression Fixes

Thank you for reporting the catastrophic performance issues in v1.13.0. This hotfix (v1.13.1) addresses all identified regressions. Please verify the fixes work with your database.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Update to v1.13.1**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/src/omnifocus-mcp
   git pull
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (quit and reopen)

3. **Verify version**: Confirm you're on 1.13.1

## 🎯 Regression Tests - Please Run These Exact Tests

### Test 1: Upcoming Tasks (CRITICAL FIX)
**v1.13.0 Result: 22,088ms ❌❌❌**
**v1.13.1 Target: <1,000ms**

```
Please run: Use query_tasks_by_date with queryType="upcoming", days=7, limit=50

Record:
- Actual response time (from metadata.query_time_ms)
- Does it return results?
- Any errors?
```

### Test 2: Overdue Tasks (CRITICAL FIX)
**v1.13.0 Result: 3,409ms ❌**
**v1.13.1 Target: <1,000ms**

```
Please run: Use query_tasks_by_date with queryType="overdue", limit=100

Record:
- Actual response time
- Does it return overdue tasks correctly?
```

### Test 3: Search Performance (CRITICAL FIX)
**v1.13.0 Result: 7,781ms ❌**
**v1.13.1 Target: <3,000ms**

```
Please run: Use list_tasks with search="review", limit=50

Record:
- Actual response time
- Does it find matching tasks?
```

### Test 4: Skip Analysis Mode
**v1.13.0 Result: Slower than normal (1,435ms vs 374ms) ❌**
**v1.13.1 Target: Should be faster than normal mode**

```
Test 4A: Use list_tasks with completed=false, limit=50, skipAnalysis=false
Test 4B: Use list_tasks with completed=false, limit=50, skipAnalysis=true

Record both times - skipAnalysis=true should be faster
```

### Test 5: Basic List Performance (Sanity Check)
**Should still be fast as in v1.13.0**

```
Please run: Use list_tasks with completed=false, limit=50

Should complete in <500ms
```

### Environment
- OmniFocus database size: ~X tasks
- macOS version: X.X
- Testing date: 2025-08-11
- Previous v1.13.0 test time: [if you have it]

### Critical Fixes Verification

| Test | v1.13.0 Time | v1.13.1 Time | Target | Status |
|------|--------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Upcoming Tasks (7 days) | 22,088ms | XXXms | <1,000ms | ✅/❌ |
| Overdue Tasks | 3,409ms | XXXms | <1,000ms | ✅/❌ |
| Search "review" | 7,781ms | XXXms | <3,000ms | ✅/❌ |
| Skip Analysis OFF | 374ms | XXXms | <500ms | ✅/❌ |
| Skip Analysis ON | 1,435ms | XXXms | <300ms | ✅/❌ |

### Fix Confirmation
- [ ] Upcoming tasks now returns in <1 second
- [ ] Overdue tasks now returns in <1 second  
- [ ] Search completes in reasonable time (<3s)
- [ ] Skip analysis is actually faster than normal
- [ ] No timeout errors encountered

### Additional Notes
[Any other observations or issues]

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Root Cause
The v1.13.0 "hybrid" implementation was iterating through ALL tasks in your database (2,194 tasks) without any pre-filtering, causing catastrophic performance degradation.

### The Fix
1. **Smarter Hybrid Approach**: JXA does initial filtering (fast), Omni Automation extracts data (reliable)
2. **Proper where() Usage**: Fixed Omni Automation filtering to use efficient where() clauses
3. **Intelligent Script Selection**: Search queries now use original JXA (can't be optimized)
4. **Pre-filtering**: All queries now filter BEFORE iterating

## ⚡ Expected Improvements

You should see:
- **Upcoming/Overdue**: 95% faster (22s → <1s)
- **Search**: 60% faster (7.8s → 2-3s)  
- **Skip Analysis**: Actually faster now (not slower)
- **No timeouts** on any operation

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

If you still see poor performance:
1. Check that `npm run build` completed successfully
2. Ensure Claude Desktop was fully restarted
3. Report the specific test that's still slow
4. Include your database size (number of tasks)

## Thank You!

Your detailed v1.13.0 test report was invaluable in identifying and fixing these critical issues. This hotfix should restore the promised performance improvements while maintaining stability.

Please test as soon as possible so we can ensure v1.13.1 is truly production-ready! 🚀
