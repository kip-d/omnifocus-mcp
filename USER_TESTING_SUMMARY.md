```
Expected: Task created with both tags in one operation

### 2. Recurring Tasks
```
"Create a weekly team meeting every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 2pm"
```
Expected: Task with proper repeat rule showing repeat icon

### 3. Task Movement
```
"Move task [ID] to the inbox"
"Move task [ID] to project 'Work'"
"Make task [ID] a subtask of [parent ID]"
```
Expected: Tasks move correctly between locations

### 4. Perspective Queries
```
"Show me tasks from my Inbox perspective"
"What's in my Flagged perspective?"
"List tasks from my custom Work perspective"
```
Expected: Returns tasks matching perspective without changing your OmniFocus window

### 5. Performance Testing
```
"Show me all overdue tasks"
"List today's tasks"
"Search for tasks with 'meeting' in the name"
```
Expected: All queries complete in < 2 seconds

## Known Issues to Ignore

- Some unit tests fail (they expect old tag limitation behavior)
- Version shows as "dirty" (uncommitted changes)

## How to Test

1. Update to latest code:
   ```bash
   git pull
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Restart Claude Desktop to reload the MCP server

3. Try the test scenarios above

4. Note any:
   - Failed tool calls
   - Slow responses (> 2 seconds)
   - Incorrect results
   - Confusing error messages

## Optional: Optimize Your AI Assistant

For best results, you can add the compact API reference to your Claude system prompt:
1. Copy contents from `docs/API-REFERENCE-LLM.md`
2. Add to your system prompt
3. This helps Claude understand all available tools

## Feedback Requested

1. **Success Rate** - What percentage of requests worked first try?
