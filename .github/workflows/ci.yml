# GitHub Actions CI for OmniFocus MCP Server
# 
# IMPORTANT: This CI runs on Ubuntu and cannot fully test OmniFocus functionality
# since OmniFocus is macOS-only. For complete testing:
# 1. Run `npm run ci:local` on macOS with OmniFocus installed
# 2. Use self-hosted macOS runners, or
# 3. Use GitHub paid plan with macOS runners
#
# This CI validates: TypeScript compilation, linting, unit tests, and basic MCP server startup
