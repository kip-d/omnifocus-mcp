# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Notes

- **TypeScript First**: This is a TypeScript project. All new code should be written in TypeScript (.ts files)
- **No JavaScript Files**: Do not create .js files for new functionality - use TypeScript
- **IMPORTANT**: This is a TypeScript project. All new code should be written in TypeScript (.ts files). Do not create .js files for new functionality - use TypeScript. This includes test files, scripts, and any other code files.
- **When creating test files or debugging scripts, always use .ts extensions and TypeScript syntax, even for quick tests or one-off scripts.**
- Before calling a project done, install the project and run integration tests (call the MCP server as Claude Desktop would do it)
- We are using Omnifocus 4.6+
- **Testing**: Use TypeScript for test files as well (e.g., .test.ts files)
- **IMPORTANT**: this is a typescript project
- **NEVER skip integration tests before considering a feature "done" or a release**

## Performance Optimization

The `list_tasks` tool now includes performance optimizations:

1. **skipAnalysis parameter**: Set `skipAnalysis: true` to skip recurring task analysis for ~30% faster queries
2. **Removed double iteration**: Tasks are now counted in a single pass (O(n) instead of O(2n))
3. **Performance metrics**: Response includes detailed timing breakdowns

Example usage for better performance:
```javascript
// Fast query - skip recurring task analysis
list_tasks({ completed: false, limit: 50, skipAnalysis: true })

// Normal query - includes full recurring task analysis  
list_tasks({ completed: false, limit: 50 })
```

Performance improvements:
- Query times reduced from 15-20s to ~1-2s for typical queries
- With skipAnalysis: ~1.2s for 10 tasks
- Without skipAnalysis: ~1.6s for 10 tasks

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Build and Development
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript (required before running)
npm run dev          # Watch mode for development
npm start            # Run the compiled server from dist/

# Testing
npm test             # Run unit tests with Vitest
npm run test:integration  # Run integration tests
npm run test:e2e     # Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:all     # Run all tests

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Lint TypeScript code
npm run typecheck    # Type checking without building

# MCP Testing
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist/index.js  # Test with MCP Inspector
node tests/integration/test-as-claude-desktop.js    # Simulate Claude Desktop protocol
```

## Architecture Overview

### Project Structure
- **src/cache/**: TTL-based caching system with automatic invalidation
- **src/omnifocus/**: OmniAutomation integration layer
  - **scripts/**: TypeScript templates for JXA script generation
- **src/tools/**: MCP tool implementations organized by domain
  - **tasks/**: Task CRUD operations
  - **projects/**: Project management
  - **analytics/**: Productivity analysis tools
  - **export/**: Data export functionality
- **src/utils/**: Logging and helper utilities

### Key Design Decisions

1. **OmniAutomation Only**: Uses only official OmniFocus APIs via JavaScript for Automation (JXA)
   - No direct database access
   - All interactions through osascript execution
   - Scripts are generated from TypeScript templates

2. **Smart Caching Strategy**:
   - Tasks: 30 seconds TTL (frequently changing)
   - Projects: 5 minutes TTL (less volatile)
   - Analytics: 1 hour TTL (expensive computations)
   - Cache automatically invalidated on write operations

3. **Error Handling**: All tool operations use try-catch with McpError for proper MCP protocol errors

4. **ID Handling**: Task IDs from OmniFocus are extracted and tracked for reliable updates

## Testing Approach

### Integration Testing Challenges
- Many integration tests timeout when accessing real OmniFocus data
- Primary testing strategy:
  1. Unit tests for business logic
  2. Protocol-level testing with test-as-claude-desktop.js
  3. Manual testing with real Claude Desktop

### Running Tests
```bash
# Quick protocol test
node tests/integration/test-as-claude-desktop.js

# Test specific functionality
node tests/integration/test-list-tasks.js
node tests/integration/test-create-task.js

# Gherkin/Cucumber tests
npm run scripts/run-cucumber-tests.sh
```

## Debugging Learnings

### Technical Insights
- **MCP server failures** are often missing build artifacts rather than configuration issues - always check `dist/` directories exist before debugging protocol-level problems
- **MCP Inspector diagnostic tool** is the proper way to test servers, but build issues prevent it from even starting the server process

### Methodological Insights
- **Direct file system checks** (ls, file existence) are faster than running complex diagnostic tools when the root cause is missing compiled output
- **Build-first debugging** - run `npm run build` immediately when TypeScript MCP servers fail to load, before investigating logs or protocol issues

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Server Won't Start
1. Check if `dist/` directory exists - run `npm run build`
2. Verify node path in Claude Desktop config points to compiled `dist/index.js`
3. Check LOG_LEVEL environment variable is valid (error, warn, info, debug)

### OmniFocus Script Timeouts
- Scripts have 60-second timeout by default
- Large task lists may exceed timeout - use pagination
- Check if OmniFocus is running and not blocked by dialogs

### Task ID Issues
- OmniFocus JXA returns temporary IDs for new tasks
- IDs are extracted from script output using regex patterns
- See src/omnifocus/scripts/tasks.ts for ID handling logic
