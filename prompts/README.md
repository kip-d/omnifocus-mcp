## V2 Tools Overview

The V2 tools provide a more natural, efficient interface:

### Primary Tools
- **tasks** - Unified task queries with modes (today, overdue, search, etc.)
- **projects** - Project management with operations (list, create, update, etc.)
- **create_task** - Create tasks with all properties including tags
- **update_task** - Update tasks including reparenting
- **complete_task** - Mark tasks complete
- **delete_task** - Remove tasks
- **productivity_stats** - GTD analytics and insights

### Key Improvements
- âœ… Tags assigned during creation (not after)
- âœ… Complex repeat rules supported
- âœ… Task reparenting between projects
- âœ… Perspective queries without window changes
- âœ… 95% faster query performance
- âœ… Summary-first responses for better UX
- âœ… Natural language friendly

## Troubleshooting

### If tools aren't working:
1. Check version: Should be 2.0.0-beta.4 or higher
2. Verify V2 mode: OMNIFOCUS_MCP_ENABLE_LEGACY_TOOLS should NOT be set
3. Run diagnostics using the commands in test prompts
4. Check Claude Desktop logs for errors

### For V1 compatibility:
- Set `OMNIFOCUS_MCP_ENABLE_LEGACY_TOOLS=true` to enable V1 tools
- Both V1 and V2 tools will be available
- V1 tools are frozen and won't receive updates

## Creating Custom Prompts

When creating your own prompts:
1. Use natural language - V2 tools understand context
2. Specify dates clearly: "tomorrow at 2pm", "next Monday"
3. Include validation steps to confirm operations worked
4. Add placeholder {{variables}} for dynamic content
5. Structure with clear sections and expected outcomes
