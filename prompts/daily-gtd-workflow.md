# Daily GTD Workflow with OmniFocus V2

Use this prompt for your daily Getting Things Done workflow with OmniFocus.

## Morning Review

Please help me with my morning review:

1. **Today's Focus**: Show me what I need to focus on today - include overdue tasks, tasks due today, and any flagged items. Keep it concise.

2. **Blocked Tasks**: Are there any tasks blocked by other incomplete tasks that I should be aware of?

3. **Quick Wins**: Show me 5 available tasks that I can complete quickly (tasks without dependencies that are ready to work on).

## Project Status Check

4. **Project Health**: Which of my projects need attention? Show me:
   - Projects that need review
   - Projects with overdue tasks
   - Stalled projects (no recent activity)

## Planning & Capture

5. **Capture**: I need to add these tasks to my inbox:
   - [Describe your new tasks here]
   - [Add as many as needed]

6. **Process Inbox**: Show me my inbox tasks so I can assign them to projects and add dates/tags.

## Focus Time

7. **Context-Based Work**: Show me all tasks tagged with [specify your context tag, e.g., "computer", "office", "home", "errands"]

8. **Time-Based Work**: I have [X] minutes available. Show me tasks I can complete in that time.

## End of Day Review

9. **Progress Check**: Show me my productivity stats for today:
   - How many tasks did I complete?
   - What's still pending?
   - What's become overdue?

10. **Tomorrow's Prep**: What's on deck for tomorrow? Show me tasks due tomorrow and any deferred tasks that will become available.

## Weekly Review Additions

For weekly reviews, also ask:

11. **Weekly Stats**: Show me my productivity statistics for the week with insights on patterns.

12. **Project Review**: Mark these projects as reviewed: [list projects you've reviewed]

13. **Someday/Maybe**: Show me on-hold projects that I should consider reactivating.

## Quick Commands

- "Flag this task: [task name]"
- "Defer [task name] until Monday"
- "Complete task: [task name]"
- "Move [task name] to project [project name]"
- "Add tags [tag1, tag2] to [task name]"
- "Create recurring task: [description] every [frequency]"
- "Show me all tasks in [project name]"
- "Search for tasks about [keyword]"

## Tips for Best Results

- Be specific with dates: "tomorrow at 2pm" or "next Friday"
- Use tags for contexts: @computer, @home, @office
- Flag only truly important tasks
- Review projects weekly to keep them active
- Use defer dates to hide tasks until they're relevant
